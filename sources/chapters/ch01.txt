# Several different possible opening vignettes here, based on a couple global decisions. Move the "possibles" story here if we're using it but aren't using the dad subplot.

[@dadPhone>I don't think I ever told this to you. When I was little, my dad used to come tuck me in at night, and sometimes I'd blink and he'd disappear. He'd be sitting on my bed, singing or smoothing my sheets or telling a story, warm and alive, and between one blink and the next he'd be gone. My heart would thump and I'd clutch the blanket, terrified, eyes thrashing back and forth across the dark spaces of my room like a trapped bird looking for a way out, looking for him, but he'd be gone, and I'd be alone.

Maybe premonition. More likely was that I'd fall asleep, waiting for him to come in, and dream he had. Some noise would jerk me up to a room where he'd long since looked in on me and pulled the door gently shut. But how I rationalize it makes no difference. It doesn't change how I lived that loss, each night it happened. How I can feel it even today. The person who loved me most, erased from existence in a blink. I'll never forget how that felt. Even if it never really happened.

[MACRO bradphoneintro][@possibles>Here's a story I don't think you ever heard. {possibles story} I'd become an expert at seeing things that weren't there. Useful, sometimes, but usually, usually...

But it taught me an important lesson. Just because something isn't real doesn't mean it can't hurt you. I'll never forget some of the things I {i/possibled}, even if they never really happened. There's truth in first impressions, in fleeting visions, even if it's not the kind we're trained to trust. Stories make shapes, build structure out of shadows: calcified shells that linger long after muddled innards fade. They're not the real thing, as gloriously as they pretend to be. But still. Sometimes they're enough.

I used to have these dreams, when I was young. Did I ever tell you this? I'd be wandering an endless beach of smooth white sand, unbroken but for a handful of deep and conical pits. I'd peer into these when I neared one, anxious, feet clenching the loose sand of its lip. Sometimes there'd be a puddle of murky water at the bottom. Sometimes a dark opening. Sometimes teeth. Even the ones without teeth ached with some invisible wrongness, were more than negative spaces in sand. They had energy, a primal liveness. They were hungry. I was fascinated and repelled by them, drawn to their edges again and again, toes curling, though I'd try to stay away. But they multiplied as I wandered, puncturing the flat sand more and more until they reduced it to a maze of pathways, then one of ridges. Inevitably I'd take a wrong step and start to slide, tumbling with the treacherous sand down toward the dark of the bottom, a point just large enough to slip through, to swallow me up. Almost always I'd wake before I reached it, but once I slid past pit-teeth and they bit me, sliced into my back, and I woke with a shock of pain so intense I screamed. I'd tumbled out of my bunk bed and fallen onto a half-assembled model; plastic struts had pierced my skin. I got rushed to the hospital in the middle of the night, mom in her dressing gown and me in bloody pajamas, and got ten stitches. I'd woken up too late. The pit had won. 

Maybe premonition, the dreams, but I think something simpler. Even that young I'd found the fears I'd struggle with well into adulthood. Losing control. Facing the unknown. And knowing that just because something isn't real doesn't mean it can't hurt you. At four years old I told myself a story of teeth and sand traps. It would take the rest of my life to understand why.

{chapter/1}


Right from the start things were wrong, but I couldn’t see it. Maybe I didn’t want to. Or maybe I’m being too hard on myself. There wasn’t exactly a roadmap for what happened[ to us], a script to follow. But it’s undeniable that even on that very first night[---the night of the Russian dance club, remember?---|, the night of the Russian dance club, ]everything was already wrong.




[MACRO We'd moved in a few weeks back][~We’d moved in a few weeks back, Niko and I and our friends, mostly his, students and lapsed students and a few brave graduates, still settling into the rambling old off-campus house we’d found in the newspaper. (Cast your mind back to a time when kids like us had figured out the internet but people old enough to own property hadn’t, so instead of browsing classifieds our bandwidth went entirely to downloading all the music in the world.)]

[DEFINE @clubintro|@makeupintro|@noodlesintro]

[*Ch1IntroScene*@clubintro>I hadn't wanted to go to the club. But Niko insisted. “Russian techno, man, one night only. That new place over by the old stadium. Lots of sexy people will be there, including us.” I ran out the usual litany of excuses: I had work in the morning, I had Bio homework to do, I hated going out to clubs with a burning passion. He batted them all away without any obvious effort, and so that's how I found myself pressed up against a wall listening to music so loud it hurt, arms crossed, feeling miserable, wishing I was back home listening to a Dvořák symphony instead.

When I could see him through the crowd, I watched Niko surf it, laughing, gesticulating wildly as he somehow held conversations despite the deafening racket, and dancing his ass off, {niko dance details} I’d worn my rainbow pride bracelet at his insistence, the one I’d bought a few months back and mostly been too chickenshit to wear (it was a college town but a conservative state). I might as well have worn a bag over my head, despite Niko's assurances that The Gays were almost definitely very into Russian techno, he was pretty sure. “Or maybe all those pulsing Slavic rhythms will make some drunk straight guy want to get all experimental and shit,” he said, waggling his eyebrows. “Never know.”

I knew. And I was right: nothing happened. No one talked to me, or even noticed me, and standing there, I couldn't imagine why they would, why anyone would want to talk to an acne-faced geek in clothes that didn't fit, leaning against a grimy wall and wishing he were anywhere else.

From across the club, Niko caught my eye, and gradually danced his way up to me, strobe lights washing out his tawny skin, twisting through his dark curls. He arrived within the eighteen-inch earshot zone and shouted something.

“What?”

He put his lips up to my ear, shouted again. “Having fun, Ryan?” He pulled back with a cheeky grin, and cackled in delight when he saw my expression, grabbing my arm. “Come on, man,” he yelled, “let's get some air.”

Dragging me through the crush of people, still dancing, bopping his head to the music, waving at some people and smirking seductively at others, he somehow managed to maneuver us through an impossible blockade of bodies without stepping on any toes or getting stepped on in return, toward a back exit I hadn't even realized existed, all while making eye contact every few steps to make sure I was okay. I'd never figured out how he managed to do so many things at once. Sometimes even one thing at a time was too much for me.

We pushed through a metal door into a blessed pillow of colder, quieter air, where a handful of smokers stood around chatting. I took a deep breath, more relieved than I'd expected to be. Niko pulled a single cigarette from behind his ear---he'd quit; someone inside must have given it to him---and bummed a light from one of the smokers. We walked a few paces farther out into the parking lot, enjoying the night air.

“So what's wrong?” he finally asked.

I sighed. “This isn't really my scene.”

“Leaving the house isn't really your scene, yeah, I get it.” He blew smoke from the side of his mouth, raising one wry eyebrow. “But you have to take chances, man. Get out of your comfort zone. I mean what was the point of coming out if you never actually {i/go out}?”

“Well it's fucking easier for you,” I said, feeling miserable. “You can sit next to some girl in class, bump into her on the street. Say sorry for spilling her coffee, waggle your eyebrows, and boom, long term relationship.”

“Yeah, that's definitely how that works,” he said. “So if it's that easy, Ry, how come I've been single for the last forever?”

“Your terrible fashion sense, probably,” I said, looking down at my sneakers, although truth be told it was a mystery to me too. It had been almost a year since his last relationship. Still more recent than mine. “Okay, lame excuse. I'm just... bad at meeting people. And I don't get how you're supposed to do it when the music's so loud you can't even think.”

He shrugged. “Serendipity is everywhere. So give it an excuse to happen to you. Get out there, take chances. I mean there's gay people everywhere, dude, even in this shithole state. You just have to man it up and figure out who they are.”

I looked up at him, startled, but he was looking away towards the horizon, expression distant, thinking about something. I looked back down at the ground before he could see me looking. {i/Stupid.}

“Should I take you home?” he asked at last.

“You don't need to babysit me.” My mood was blackening. “I can look after myself.”

“So do. No point making yourself miserable if you're not having fun.”

“I thought...” I didn't know how to finish. I thought he'd wanted me to come. I thought if he were here, maybe I'd enjoy it. I thought I could pretend to be a person who enjoyed clubs, crowds, Russian techno. I'd thought, despite all evidence, that tonight would be different. 

“You're right. Guess I should jet.” Hoping my voice wouldn't betray what was welling up inside me, I looked up, met his eyes with the best fake smile I could muster. “Catch you later, man.”

He looked straight back at me and I could tell he wasn't buying any of it.

Flicking the cigarette onto the asphalt, he ground it out with his heel, clapped my shoulder. “I'll come with you.”

“No, you don't have to,” I said, flooded by an awkward admixture of guilt and relief. “I'm fine. You go back in there and have some fun. Find some hot pixie chick with feathers weaved into her hair and go wild.”

He shot me an annoyed look, brushing black curls back from his eyes. “Orion. I said I'm coming with you.” He put an arm around my shoulder and guided me into the parking lot. “The hot chicks in there obviously have terrible taste in music, if that's what you could call what they were playing. I expect you might have some opinions about that.”

“{i/Well},” I said, emphatic, and laughed, surprised at myself. At him. He had a way of turning things around like that. Defeat into victory. No into yes. Everything was better again, at least for now.

Talking, laughing, we struck out into the night for the long walk home.

|@makeupintro>

I was on the back porch, looking over the dying backyard grass at the sunset reddening the top of college hill. {We'd moved in a few weeks back} My Bio homework was in my lap but I couldn't remember what page the reading started on, or why I cared. All I could think about was whether the words I'd said that morning had cost me my best friend.

So when I heard him force his way into the house through the juddering side door, perpetually stuck, I stiffened. He'd stormed out after the argument and I hadn't heard from him since. I hadn't even started to work through my feelings about it, what I'd said and what I hadn't. I didn't know what to say to him now. Which one of us needed to apologize, or for what.

I tensed, waiting to hear if he'd head upstairs to his room or find me out here, not sure which I wanted. The possibility seemed suspended, unresolved, for an uncomfortably long time.

The screen door creaked and Niko stepped out onto the porch. I didn't turn around. He walked over and stood at the railing next to me, an unlit cigarette between his lips, facing the twilight. 

He sucked on the cigarette for a long minute ineffectually, distracted, then slipped it back into his pocket. Gripped the railing.

“Hey,” he finally said, “wanted to invite you out. With a bunch of us,” he added, a bit too smooth. “There's this new dance club over by the old stadium. Supposedly they play this fucking feral, crotch-pummeling Russian dance music and lots of sexy people will be there tonight, including us.”

“Huh.” I blinked, not quite getting what this was. “Not really my thing.”

“I mean in a weird way it kind of might be? I mean you like Shostakovitch, right? He's Russian. And isn't techno sort of the people's music of the modern day? Simple, rhythmic, obnoxiously loud?”

He was reaching. It was kind of sweet but I still felt sullen. “Is this you apologizing?”

He let out a breath, deflating. “I don't know what you want from me, man. After everything we've been through together, you think we'd be past this kind of shit.”

I couldn't think of what to say. I realized I was being unfair but I also felt terrible unresolved wounds between us. The things I'd said that morning hadn't stopped being true. {i/You're smothering me. I can't always be there for you. Sometimes you're too much.}

{i/Sometimes, I feel like I can't escape you.} I hadn't said that last one.

But. I also hated to feel estranged from him. I wanted everything back the way it was before. More than anything.

We let the twilight happen to us for another couple minutes.

“It is me apologizing,” he said at last. “You're my best friend, Ryan. I can't stand to have you angry at me. I need you to---” He stopped, face reddening, scuffed his feet on the deck. “I mean I'd like to have you around.” He pulled the cigarette out again, had it to his lips before realizing the lighter he'd thrown out a week ago still wasn't in his pocket. He sighed and dropped it onto the lawn.

“So come out to the club,” he said. “We can hate Russian techno together. I'll buy the drinks. Let's go have a good time. Yeah?”

“I've got Bio homework.” I looked down at the still-closed textbook in my lap, face reddening. “And I don't want to be around a lot of loud drunk people tonight. Or loud drunk music.”

“It won't be any fun if you aren't there,” he said quietly.

I looked up and met his glance, excepting the vulnerability I'd only seen there a handful of times, but found something else. The half-grin and cocked eyebrow that said he wasn't taking no for an answer, and maybe it said something else, or I wanted to pretend it did. His eyes were so fucking sharp. When they looked at you and wanted something, it hurt.

I sighed. “I'm going to hate it.”

“Yeah you are.” He grinned wickedly. “Every second. We're leaving at eight. I'll knock on your door.” He clapped me on the shoulder. “Who knows. Maybe some drunk straight guy will start making out with you cause Russian techno makes him feel all experimental and shit.”

“That'll definitely happen.”

“What was the point of coming out,” he said, already on his way back inside, “if you never actually {i/go out}?” He mimed dropping a mic and his head exploding, and {niko was gone and I was committed} 

|@noodlesintro>I was in the kitchen making ramen, that big kitchen with its vintage appliances and endless counter space, wasted on college kids. {We'd moved in a few weeks back}

I was stirring noodles when Niko forced his way in through the side door, perpetually stuck, the soul-juddering screech of metal on wood already a familiar sound, a sound of home. We’d stopped using the front door for reasons I no longer remember, so everyone came and left through that massive kitchen. He was crooning some song I didn't know, and flashed his searing grin in my direction when he caught my eye, dancing his way over to me.

“Ryan, my man,” he said, clapping me on the shoulder. “It is a goddamned beautiful day out there. What the deuce is up?”

“Dinner,” I said, smiling despite myself. The temperature always rose a few degrees when he came into a room, like he radiated in all frequencies, emotional and thermal.

“Ooh,” he said, wafting some steam from the pot up towards his nose like Food Network cameras were rolling. “Oriental flavor ramen. So international. Can I get in on that?”

“Made two,” I said, tapping the empty plastic packages with the fork. I figured he'd be back from class and hungry, like on most nights. Feeding him was easier than explaining why he felt awful when he forgot to eat.

“You're a rockstar.” He reached a bronzed hand into the pot to pinch up a couple noodles, winced at the heat and slurped them up. “Hey,” he added, mouth full, “what are you doing tonight?”

“Oh, no.”

“Hear me out.” He swallowed. “There's a bunch of people, like everyone, really, heading out to Orbits later. Heard of it?” I shook my head; he rolled his eyes. “Course you haven't. It's that new dance club over by the old stadium.”

“Huh.” I stirred. “Not really my thing.”

“Leaving the house isn't really your thing, yeah, I get it. But sometimes you have to get outside your comfort zone, you know?” He licked his fingers and fixed me with a look that said he wasn't taking no for an answer, and maybe it said something else, or I wanted to pretend it did. His eyes were so fucking sharp. When they looked at you and wanted something, it hurt.

“Uh. I've got Bio homework.” I blinked. Green. His eyes were green. “And I don't want to be around a lot of loud drunk people tonight. Or loud drunk music.”

“Oh {i/come on},” he pleaded, running a hand through his black curls. “It won't be any fun if you aren't there. Hey, maybe some drunk straight guy will start making out with you cause Russian techno makes him feel all experimental and shit.”

“That'll definitely happen.”

“Look man, what was the point of coming out if you never actually {i/go out}?” He crossed his arms. “Come on. Please?”

It clicked then that {i/he} was the one hoping to get some action tonight, probably with some sweet-smelling, dark-skinned exchange student with feathers weaved into her long, black hair. (Yes, {i/her}. I know, I know.) She was the one he wanted to take to this club. She was probably why he was in such an ecstatic mood. The thought of watching from a corner while he made moves on some intoxicating girl made my stomach knot up.

But there was something insistent in the way he demanded my presence. Why did he want me there, too? What role was I supposed to play?

I sighed. “I'm going to hate it.”

“Yeah you are.” He grinned wickedly. “Every second. We're leaving at eight. I'll knock on your door.” And he {niko was gone and I was committed}

{section_break}

We’d been friends since freshman year of college and best friends since the year after that, and by now felt like something more, placidly absorbing jokes about being joined at the hip, going everywhere together. [We were; we did|We did]. Especially since his accident, we’d had a profound if unspoken level of companionship I’d never felt with anyone. Usually I was content with that.

In some ways we had so little in common it was astonishing we'd become friends, and that led to frequent arguments, sometimes rising to breakup levels of drama. At other moments it seemed like the universe had meant us to find each other. Over the years we'd grown together, like two plants in the same small pot. It had been an especially tumultuous [four years of college|gauntlet of an undergrad]---although I guess it feels that way for everyone---so shared roots twined us together now, [half-remembered fragments of stories and selves|stuff we never talked about but didn't have to]: skipping a funeral to camp together in the rocky canyons of Brushwillow, sharing long silences amidst the lakes and pines; pulling all-nighters on mad projects with desperate stakes; driving to the next town over through a summer midnight, windows rolled down and air thrumming through, desperate to find fresh vegetables for reasons that seemed incredibly important at the time, buzzed from both caffeine and alcohol as in so many stories involving Niko. In our defense the alcohol was supposed to go in the ragu. 

[@clubintro>|I’d hated the club, as predicted. The music was so loud it hurt, almost as much as it hurt to call the shit they were blasting “music.” I’d worn my rainbow pride bracelet, the one I’d bought a few months ago and mostly been too chickenshit to wear (it was a college town but a conservative state). I might as well have worn a bag over my head. Everyone ignored me, including the hypothetical hot guys with loosened inhibitions. I stood against a wall hating myself and hating how I must have looked to everyone, an acne-faced geek in too-small clothes lurking on the outskirts, wishing he was back home listening to Dvořák symphonies. {maybech1alcbit} I watched Niko dance his ass off, {niko dance details} But he, too, seemed to fail at making any solid human connections{girl bit if noodles}and I was relieved when he cornered me and asked if I wanted to duck out early.]

[MACRO girl bit if noodles][@noodlesintro>---the hypothetical supermodel exchange student either didn't exist or failed to appear---|, ]
[MACRO maybech1alcbit][@alcohol>I drank too much, as usual, and as usual it didn’t help.]

Walking back home from the club through the chill night air with him was a relief[@alcohol>, and not only because the shots were starting to hit me and walking a straight line on my own would have been rough]. The night felt endless, anonymous, an escape from daytime problems[@makeupintro>; the argument that morning already a long-forgotten memory, ancient history]. In the fall we'd be starting our fifth year of college, neither of us particularly close to graduating with any particular degree, and for the first time that felt ominous. The future staked out before us our whole lives was running out. A blank canvas ought to have been exciting, but any direction we could imagine to go in seemed blocked off, already closed, inaccessible or unrealistic. Friends were picking already between the remaining well-flagged routes: getting careers, getting married, getting pregnant, getting gone to new cities, new lives, new starts. It would be our turn soon enough.

By the time we hit the top of the hill and saw the house, we were ready to be back indoors. [@clubintro>{We'd moved in a few weeks back}] I'd gotten ranty about real music on the walk back, and as we stepped through the juddering screen door, its metal-on-wood screech already a familiar sound, I had a half-dozen songs queued up to play for him. [@clubintro>{pp}]Mentally, I mean: digital music players hadn't caught on yet back then, although it was still tragically too late for my records to be anything but anachronism. Vinyl wouldn't start making a comeback for years and was deader than dead. Maybe that was why I liked it. When we moved in I’d stacked my crates of LPs in the closet, so now as we tromped up the stairs to my room and dragged them out to hunt for the albums I wanted to play, we got [@alcohol>drunkenly] annoyed at the lack of anywhere to put them. So that was how I ended up on my hands and knees, searching for a way to open up my bed.







“Bed” was generous: it was a mattress, thrown on a raised wooden platform built into a corner of the room. [The platform was mattress-sized and had therefore|Mattress-sized, it had] seemed like the sensible spot to put one, but [the bulky thing also really seemed like it ought to be hollow and have|it also felt as if it should have had] some storage space inside. I’d never found any handles or hinges, but [@alcohol>in our drink-addled haze|with late-night logic] it seemed ridiculous that the thing couldn’t be opened somehow, and because I can’t leave well enough alone and because unsolved challenges annoy me, [@alcohol>and, okay, because booze,] there I was on hands and knees fiddling with the paneled edges of the platform, shoving and kneading and banging on them. When something finally gave with a satisfying {i/chunk}, I whooped in satisfaction; but leapt back startled when the whole platform groaned and swung up, pencils and organic chemistry textbooks sliding off the mattress onto the pitted hardwood floor.

Underneath was a set of steep stairs down.

“Whoah,” Niko said, “Jackpot.”

They were carpeted in the same dark beige as the rest of the house, which looked like someone had redecorated in the seventies and died decades later unaware style had moved on. [Ten|Eleven|Twelve] steps led down to a landing where they twisted right and reversed. Cramped, but bland and familiar: the walls paneled in that same fake wood as the rest of the house, lit by those same tacky wall sconces. All as you'd expect from the stairs down to a basement, except we were on the second story and the house already had a basement, which emphatically did not connect through my bed.

Niko laughed in astonishment. “What the fuck is this, man? What’s down there?”

“Hell if I know. More secrets.” We were grinning, because this sort of thing had already happened a few times since we’d moved in. The house had been my find. The group of us were getting older (or so we thought then) and were [sick of living in shitty campus housing or the shittier apartments nearby preying on starving students|looking to move up in the world], so we pooled our resources to go in on a house in the pleasant tree-lined neighborhood a few blocks farther out. It was an old house, [maybe as much as a hundred years old,] but big, in good repair, and, most important, cheap: we were all paying less rent than when living in pairs or alone. I'd claimed the funky second-floor patio room in a lumpy wing extending into the backyard, clearly a later addition, and Niko snagged a creaking and stuffy room next to mine which he dubbed “lovingly misshapen.” A lot of the place was like that: a half-landing here, an awkward angle there, bits taken out and bricked over on some whim or other. The house had expanded and contracted over the generations, it seemed, in decades-long breaths. 

[The listing hadn't mentioned a secret passage. But it also hadn’t mentioned the closet with a door in the back leading to a dusty, forgotten room (which now housed a dusty, forgotten game of Axis and Allies); nor had it mentioned the extra bedroom in the basement tucked away around a corner and behind an unlikely-looking door. These small discoveries gave the place a quirky, rambling feel, and I loved it. My whole life I'd had dreams about finding new rooms in houses I'd lived in, each time with a thrill of discovery, of learning your cozy domain still had surprises, things left to find. Maybe it came from moving around all the time as a kid. Or maybe it said something about me. 

I still had them, the dreams. I didn't know they were about to get much worse.]

Niko touched the angled bottom of the bed platform and looked at me, as if for permission. He gestured grandly downwards. “Well, Orion, should we check it out?”

I gave him a formal bow, [@alcohol>the room only spinning a little|feeling puckish, giddy]. “Indeed, Nikolaos, let's fucking do it.”

He grinned and tousled my hair, bounding over the lip. He stooped as he took the first few steps, black curls brushing the underside of the tilted platform. 

“You going to fit down there?” I smirked. “This looks made for normal-sized people, not basketball players.”

“High school power-forward Nick appreciates your validation of his identity, thanks,” he called back, almost to the landing. “College dilettante Niko, though, wants to know if you're fucking coming.”

I hesitated on the threshold, strangely reluctant.

He turned from the landing to look back up, arms folded. “I'm not {i/that} tall, am I? I've only got like three inches on you and your---” He flailed a hand up and down at me. “Your demographically average carcass. Stop giving me complexes.”

{i/Actually you're exactly four and a half inches taller than me. But who's counting.}

He shrugged, continued down the next set of stairs and out of sight. “Later, skater.”

I flipped his skinny ass off and followed him down.

[DEFINE @diary|@livejournal]
Despite his complaints, Niko was in fact wearing a basketball jersey, but an ironic one from the thrift store, for some hopefully-fictional team called the Reagans. He wore a purple blazer over it, which I trust is all I need say about his fashion sense. Somehow, it worked. His horrifying ensembles always worked, whereas the clothes I’d buy, new or used, turned ugly, permanently wrinkled, and the wrong size by the time I got them home. “Dear [@diary>Diary,” I'd imagined writing in my nonexistent diary,|LiveJournal,” I'd written once in my private, locked LiveJournal account,] “I get now that I’m destined to die alone. You can stop sending me signs.” [@diary>You used to put self-deprecating shit like that in diaries, back before social media was invented. Not  bothering to keep the actual diary was about as unsatisfying as typing and erasing status messages without ever posting them; so if you do that a lot, I can relate.|I had never shared my LiveJournal account with anyone and never would, which some people had told me was missing the point. Nowadays on social media I do a lot of typing and erasing status messages without posting them. Maybe you can relate.]
[MACRO diary][@diary>Diary|LiveJournal]

Anyway. Niko had shrugged his shoes off when we’d gotten to my room, and now his bare feet sunk half an inch into carpet as he tromped down the stairs[, which was the detail I noticed]. His feet were hard not to notice: maybe it was all the basketball, or the Greek ancestry, but they were like statuary. Perfect.

The stairs were steep but otherwise unextraordinary. Around the corner, more of them dropped to a second landing. We stomped down, Niko's drunken excitement leading us on[ like a dog straining at a leash]. Past that corner was one more landing and one final run of steps[ that|. They] opened into a large, windowless room.

It was bigger than any other room in the house, maybe [thirty|twenty-five|thirty-five] feet across by [sixty or seventy|fifty or sixty|seventy-five or eighty] long. [(Logically it ought to have been the same size as the house's footprint, but both the dimensions and orientation were wrong for that.)] It had the same beige carpet and brown wall-paneling, tacky faux-bronze wall-sconces, and a plaster ceiling eight feet up. [Firewood was stacked up by two fireplaces on opposite walls, in the same style as the non-functional one upstairs hidden by our TV.] No windows, not even those awful basement ones that fill up with dead leaves and spider webs. [@furnished>A smattering of old couches and end tables lined the walls, along with|No furniture, either. Just] the expected bits of floor lint, carpet stains, wall gouges, and other subtle remnants of long occupation. A cool, musty smell suggested said occupation had been a long time ago.

Five open doorways led out: two along each long edge, and one on the far wall opposite the stairs.

“Holy shit, Ry, this is fucking amazing!” Niko's eyes lit up as he walked a few paces in[, tentative, like into a tide]. He flexed his bare toes on the ugly carpet. “It's like a whole secret underground lair!”

I felt the same thrill, [mingled|mixed|tempered] with hesitation. Did our landlord somehow not know about all this extra space? Was it some kind of forgotten bomb shelter? Niko was already talking about throwing parties down here, [@furnished>cleaning up the|where to put] couches. A secret basement hangout spot.

[DEFINE 20>@convopit]
We called it Downstairs, big D[, without really thinking about it]. [@convopit>The only noteworthy feature was a circular depression in the floor which confused Niko but which I recognized as a conversation pit.

“This was a whole thing in the sixties,” I said. “See, you would sit in here, and you would talk.”

“Huh.” He nudged the lip skeptically with his toe. “What's wrong with having a conversation, like, anywhere else?”

“Well, you could, but then you wouldn't be having it {i/in the conversation pit}.”]

The architecture was making my head spin, though. [@alcohol>(Okay: also the beer.) But someone|Someone] else's bedroom was under mine. I felt an indignant vertigo, and made Niko come resolve this mystery before exploring any farther. We went back up to my room, then downstairs---regular lower-case downstairs---to reconnoiter. There was, in fact, an odd protrusion into the kitchen underneath and to one side of my room, and when we peeked into our absent housemate's bedroom around the corner, a mirroring blocky bulge in there. So together those two bulges explained the stairs, though not why you'd build a staircase in the middle of a wall like that. But the house was full of those weird angles and edges, so it seemed in character. 

We went back Downstairs and [poked around|peeked into] a few of the side hallways. Pretty cramped, but no worse than other god-awful basement apartments I'd seen students living in. Like some of those, there were no windows anywhere, which made sense: it felt too far down. Rooms opened off the sides of the halls (those cheap particle-board doors, those rattling brass-plated tin doorknobs). Some were carpeted and looked like they could be bedrooms; others had bare concrete flooring like a laundry or utility room. [@furnished>Most had a piece or two of abandoned furniture, all decades out of date, dusty, and anonymous.|They were all empty.]

The hallways branched at the end: we picked one and saw both ways passed more doors before making L-turns, each in opposite directions. Those crappy wall sconces were everywhere, so despite the lack of windows, it was almost too bright. They were all lit, and weirdly enough we couldn't find a light switch anywhere.

“[Are we|You don't think we're][^, uh,] paying for all this electricity?” Niko asked[ with jittery alarm|, alarmed].

“We haven't gotten our first bill yet.” [@alcohol>I felt proud for not slurring my speech; witty.|I raised my eyebrows.] “Good thing we're splitting eight ways.”

We [didn't exhaustively explore, beyond checking|only explored a little farther, looking into] another hallway and seeing that it, too, branched and snaked off, shedding rooms left and right. Niko had started down that one, but I stopped, [@alcohol>a wave of nausea washing over me|hit by a wave of unexplained dizziness], and put a hand against the cold wall.

He stopped instantly. “You okay?”

[@alcohol>I smiled, embarrassed. “I think, uh. Don’t want to get too far from a bathroom.”

He eyed me appraisingly. “You shouldn’t have done that last shot. I keep telling you. Beer before liquor, never sicker.”|“I don't know.” My head pulsed with another wave of nausea, this time with an undercurrent of dread, maybe from not knowing what it was. “I think I'm going to be sick.”

“You drink too much at the club or something?” I shook my head. I'd had one beer. And this didn't feel like being drunk, or like a migraine, or like anything else I could label.

It just felt like something was wrong.

“I need to go lie down,” I said firmly. 

] He tousled my hair again, but gently. “Okay, man. Hang on just one sec. I need to see the end of this fucking hallway and then we’ll get you back upstairs.”

I didn’t want him to leave but couldn’t think of any sane reason to stop him[ that didn’t sound needy], so I nodded and let him go. Too many vaguely ill feelings were churning around inside me to sort them out from each other.

“I’ll wait here,” was all I could say, the thought of walking back up twisting stairs feeling for a queasy moment like a bad idea.

He was already halfway down the hall, but lifted a hand in acknowledgment. Moments later he’d turned the corner and was gone.

It was suddenly very quiet.

I sunk to a sitting position, knees at my chin, back against the fake wood-paneling. [@alcohol>{i/Why do you always, always drink too much? Idiot.} I tried to focus on|I tried to turn my focus inward, self-diagnose whatever was happening, but my thoughts slipped off the sense of growing unease like a car on black ice, unable to gain traction. Instead I focused on] the feel of the carpet under my butt, the smoothness of the wall at my back. [@alcohol>I tried not to think about my stomach.|Tangible, external things. Safe.]

{i/Please, please hurry back.}

[And then something|^Something] changed around me, subtle but significant. Head swimming, I couldn’t lock on to what, at first, was different. I blinked, squinted.

The light. The play of light around me had changed, gone darker, even though none of the wall sconces in my field of vision had gone out or gotten dimmer.

We were at a T-junction, where the hall we’d come from, back to the big room with the five doorways, had branched in two directions. I was slumped against the wall facing the way we’d come, head turned towards the right-hand fork, the way Niko had gone.

I decided the dimming must have come from the lights in the hall behind me, the one we hadn't explored yet. They must have gone out. 

Careful, still fighting nausea, I turned my head.

[^I’ve always had an unhealthy imagination. This has manifested itself in various ways over the course of my life. Staying under the covers reading comics instead of doing homework, or sleeping.

Things get lodged in my head and they stay there, sometimes for too long.]

The [other|unexplored] hall was dark. The [lights were off|wall sconces were unlit], and the dark brown walls sucked up the refracted light from the other two hallways, so that the end of this one, where it turned another corner, was right at the edge of shadow.

they were moving again, lifting up the other foot, still slow, still hesitant, following the double[@ryanAndNiko>s] in almost perfect synchronicity. Like they were glued together.

They put the feet down, gentle, soundless on the thick carpet.

Another pace closer. [@facingback>Still turned away.]

[@alcohol>{i/Seeing double. You're drunk.} Except I'd never had it happen in three dimensions before, along the z-plane. And the edges of the hall weren't doubled at all.]

I wondered how many more were stacked up behind them. How many more I couldn’t see, each pressed up against the last, a line vanishing into the darkness, stretching back god knows how far, patient, waiting for something I could never understand.

I wondered what they wanted.

I wondered how fast they could reach me if they started to [@facingback>walk backwards, toward me, at a steady pace|run].

“What you looking at?” Niko asked[@ryanAndNiko>| from behind me], and I {i/leapt}, fucking leapt to my feet like the floor was electric, whirling around to face him, body in full panic as all the building adrenalin flooded through me in an instant; panting and overwhelmed with terror and nausea and a terrible, stabbing relief at seeing him, seeing [@justRyan>a him I could believe in instead of a me I couldn’t|@justNiko>a him that was familiar instead of a thing that wasn't|an us I could believe in instead of a pair I couldn't].

“The lights [^back there] went out,” I said, gasping, not looking behind me. Also, more certain: “I need to throw up.”

He clapped my shoulder, grim. “Let’s get you back upstairs.”

I let him shepherd me away. I didn’t look back down the hall.

But as we left, his arm protective on my shoulders, he frowned. [@ch1stinger>“Pretty sure those lights were out when we first came down here, man.”|“Didn't find the end of the hall, man. This place is freaking huge.”]

[MACRO possibles story][~In sixth grade I had a brief friendship with a weird, indrawn kid with the same unhealthy imagination as me. He liked to {i/possible}. When you catch something from the corner of your eye, he’d explained, and it looks for an instant like something fantastic---a witch’s face in a hedge, a huge monstrous far-off thing instead of a tiny nearby insect---instead of correcting your perceptions, you let yourself keep believing in that first impression for as long as you can. You {i/possible} it. Hold it in your head, your mental model of what's real. Keep your mind from asserting the boring truth it thinks it knows and trust the one your senses first perceived. And I’d tried this, with him and on my own, off and on for a few weeks until I scared myself because I was getting too good at it. So was he: I realized it before long when he started scaring me with stories about the things he’d seen, and I think his parents or the school figured it out not long after, because they took him away and I got sent to a counselor for a few weeks just for being friends with him.

But you don’t unlearn something like that. Not completely.]
