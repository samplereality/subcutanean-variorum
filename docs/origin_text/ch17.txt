# Last light
[The flooded bathroom was|The room below was, in fact, a bathroom,] lined [in|with] tile that [might have been a pale yellow but] glowed {color4} in the light of [@originalniko>our glowsticks|my glowstick]. Chromium sink fixtures and a frosted-glass shower threw back {color4adj} light. In contrast to the other flooded chambers there was no mold, no algae, no water damage. It might have been flooded seconds before. 

I didn't pause to wonder about this, but kicked off through the open door into a murky hall, following the guide rope which led onwards like Niko had [@originalniko>predicted. He followed behind, pulling himself hand over hand along the rope|said].

I focused on my strokes, old swimming lessons coming back. This was a different sort of lane, of course: the floor brown carpet, plaster-of-paris above instead of a shimmering boundary of air. And the wounded leg slowed me down: it hurt, every time I kicked. But I wasn't worried, not yet. I had good lungs. I could swim for a while.

The rope turned a corner into a large unfurnished room with a half-dozen washers and dryers piled in a corner. [@originalniko>We|I] swam past them, mechanical, calm, following the rope through an open doorway opposite.

Through the door was what looked like a small porch or mud room. Boots and shoes tumbled weightless in the water. The rope stopped here, tied to a capped metal pipe. The opposite wall was a sliding glass patio door. 

The airlock.

Through the glass it was dark. [@originalniko>But faintly, through water rippling as if moving with strange, hot currents, there: another sliding door. Distance was impossible to judge, but it couldn't have been more than twenty-five or thirty feet away, suspended in a dark and empty void.

And framed in that window was a figure, silhouetted by the {color4} glowstick he was holding.

Another me.

It could have been a mirror, except he was alone.

The water trembled and around us foundations groaned, but I reached down and grabbed Niko's hand and held it tight against the wriggling water, and he gripped it back. We stared across the gap at my double, defiant. I realized half the sick anxiety I'd been feeling was from my growing proximity to him, subsumed by the general terror of what we were doing. But that wasn't why I gripped Niko's hand so tight.

We were breaking the rules of this place. Staring asynchrony in the face. And we weren't backing down.

We were going through anyway.

The rumbling petered out, died away. Shoes disturbed by the shaking drifted around us, their long laces waving like antennae. 

All this had taken only seconds. I knew every one mattered. Across the gap I saw the other Ryan reach for his sliding glass door, and found myself doing the same, unsure which of us had moved first.

In lockstep, our doors slid open, and we swam forward into the black water between, me tugging Niko behind. As we reached the portal the floor and ceiling dropped away.|All I could see was my own {color4} reflection holding the glowstick. Seeing myself floating there, a hit of adrenaline coursed through me. How much air was left in my lungs? More than half what I'd started with? Doubt flooded into me. {i/This is crazy. I can't do this.} I forced the thought from my mind, replaced it with: {i/Just hurry. Hurry and get it over with.}

I slid the glass door open and forced myself into the black water beyond. The ground dropped off on the other side, and there was no ceiling, either.] Everything was dark.

And as [@originalniko>we|I] swam past the threshold something {i/changed}.

[Everything changed.] The water cooled; the pressure and ambient sound in my ears shifted. [@originalniko>The other sliding door was just ahead of us, but it seemed too as if we|I could see the vague outlines of another sliding door just ahead of me, but it seemed too as if I] floated in a cavernous space, a space beyond measuring, the other door impossibly distant. Disoriented, I turned around to shut the one [@originalniko>we'd|I'd] come through---remembering they couldn't both be open at once---and as I did another shock of {i/change} swept through me, crystallizing into something immense, yawning, terrorful. I remembered the spring Elder Niko had spoken of
[@vortex>{verse_inline/this stream}|@gardens>{verse_inline_sc/EXPANDING ONCE AGAIN}|@snakeoil>{verse_inline_sc/EXPANDING ONCE AGAIN}|@caves>{verse_inline/pools as clear as air}]
deep at the roots of this place: a spring that split and split and split again, endless. I felt possibilities branching in the water around me, but even more in the waters inside me, in the part of me inside the waters. Branching, expanding, growing like mold in a petri dish but spilling out of the dish now, spreading through the lab into the walls, the world
[@vortex>{verse_inline/A looking-glass held}|@gardens>{verse_inline_sc/YOUR FUTURES}|@snakeoil>{verse_inline_sc/SUCH WONDERS}|@caves>{verse_inline/down in cool places}|,]
and it was as if I was the mold, the spring, an effervescent source spilling out into infinite variation, branches branching and branched again into an unfillable space, filling it. Boundless, multiplied. Multiplicious.

Slowed by dream-syrup, fighting awed stupor from these whispers of immensity, I turned my back on that powerful water at the center, pulled the glass door shut, staring numb as it slid implacable down its track[@originalniko>, while behind me the other Ryan did the same. Our doors clicked shut.

And as we turned around to swim across that heady gap, facing each other again, we both raised our glowsticks high. And then we saw them.

Drifting in that immense and empty space, lit a gangrenous {color4} by our chemical lights, there were more of us.

Dozens. Floating, unbreathing. Eyes open.

Watching. 

I screamed, bubbles of precious oxygen exploding from my mouth, and then they came for us.

I twisted around and|.

In the last second before the door clicked shut and my glowstick guttered out, I saw something reflected in the glass. There were people floating behind me.

They drifted in that immense and empty space, lit a gangrenous {color4} by the light of my glowstick. Three of them. All with my body, my clothes. My face. Their wide-open eyes ({i/my} eyes) were fixed on me as they floated gently forward, converging.

Their grasping hands reached out for me, and then the door clicked shut, and everything went black.

I screamed, bubbles of precious oxygen exploding from my mouth. I] yanked the handle of the door, but it wouldn't budge. I clawed at it, slammed my fist against the glass. [@originalniko>|The darkness was absolute, thickened by the potent water into a solid, crushing thing.] The door wouldn't open and they were right behind [@originalniko>they were coming they were going to get us|me they were coming they were going to get me][@singular02>, a catastrophe of self that nothing human could undo,] and I {i/twisted} wildly, pressed hands to the glass behind me, [@originalniko>but it was hopeless. There were too many of them, drifting forward with hands outstretched, serene expressions on their faces.|trying to guess their position, but it was hopeless. I couldn't see. I'd squandered my air. Hands would close around my neck, my face, and I'd scream again one last time and drown, thrashing in pain and terror and darkness.] [@originalniko>Beside me, Niko was preparing to push off against the glass and make a break for the other side, but faltered as he saw what was happening across from us.

The other Ryan had failed to open his door, too, but as he'd turned around a coincidence had pried apart our synchronicity even further. There were more of the floating Ryan-things on his side---an accident of distribution maybe---and the few seconds Niko and I had to act had already run out for him. As he bent his legs to push off from the glass door, they reached him.

He screamed, eyes going wide as their fingers wrapped around his hair, caressed his arms, reached pale white fingers into his mouth. Bubbles of air exploded from it as he twisted frantically, trying to shake them off. Hands closed around his neck, twisted his arms, pulled his head back by his hair to a terrible angle; hands that seemed unsure if they meant to caress or kill. He was panicking, writhing in the water like a trapped eel, dying. 

Before we could move or even start swimming forward to help him, his body spasmed as he breathed in.

He {i/breathed in}.

It's a horrible thing to watch yourself drown. My brain disconnected, floated away, observed only in abstractions as the me across the gap spasmed and convulsed, surrounded by things that shared our face, pressing forward, closer, eager, like they wanted to feed off the flicker of his death. The guttering {color4} of his thrashing glowstick was doubled, reflecting mirrored patterns in the glass behind him.

Something was wrong with that.

More of the Ryan-things were drifting toward us, Niko was yanking frantic at my arm, but I couldn't move, couldn't react, struggling to grasp that fleeting thought like a half-remembered dream. Neurons tried to spark. The doubled reflection. Something had almost slipped into place. {maybe cdrom bit}

A glowstick and its reflection, now gone horribly still. But the closer one was occluded by the swarming forms, the shadows that swam around it.

The one in the reflection was clear. In the glass, its light was unobstructed.

In the glass, there were no swarming figures. They weren't real.

{i/They weren't real.}

There was no way, no time to explain this to Niko. So I wrapped my arms around him tight, felt for the glass door with my legs, shut my eyes, and pushed off hard towards the swarm of encroaching Orions,|Alone.

{i/No.}

Anger pierced through fear. Maybe I had issues and maybe I'd made mistakes, and maybe I even deserved this, to be strangled by my own soulless doppelgangers in a shitty basement apartment with delusions of grandeur. But I didn't want to die, and being alone had nothing to do with it. I wasn't going to let this happen to me just because {never dad or brad}. None of that mattered. I was still here. I was still alive.

For now.

{i/Think.}

They'd been coming from three angles, two above and one below.

In the middle there'd been a gap.

Gripping my panic by the neck before it ran wild, snarling like a cornered animal, I put my feet against the glass door behind me and pushed off hard,] as hard as I could.

[MACRO maybe cdrom bit][@cdrom>Like a puzzle in that damn adventure game, a puzzle you don't even know if there's an answer to until the moment you see it.]
[MACRO never dad or brad][@dadphone>dad would never be back to tuck me in, just because I'd never hear Niko's laugh again and he wouldn't be there next time to save my ass|@bradphone>my first love had betrayed me and I couldn't forgive him, just because my second was trapped in another universe and I could never, ever see him again]

The pain in my wounded calf went white-hot but I barely noticed it. I shot straight forward, intent, [@originalniko>right through the mass of things closing in.|threading the gap like a needle, right through the center of the things closing in.

I hoped.]

Something brushed my leg. I kicked forward[@originalniko> with|, pulled water with cupped hands and] all the strength I had. Two fingertips bounced off my forehead, trailed through my hair, but [@originalniko>we were moving too fast for them, we were through, we were past them|I was moving too fast for them, I was through, I was past them]. I'd [fucking] done it.

[@originalniko>We'd reached the glass door on the other side; below us, the drowned Orion sank into erasing darkness, no longer struggling. I couldn't help him. But Niko was kicking and thrashing in what I'd assumed was terror at the illusory {double things}. To pull the door open I'd have to let him go. But as I did I realized the reason for his panic was far more serious.

He was out of air.

Whether he'd lost the last of it screaming, whether his smoker's lungs were just inferior to mine: it didn't matter. I could tell at a glance he wouldn't make it to the other side. He wouldn't even make it through the door. His face was filled up with crushing desperation, a look that counted seconds until the overwhelming urge to breathe took hold of him. They were almost gone. His lungs were empty.

So I pressed my mouth to his and filled them up. I gave him the last of my breath. 

His eyes went wide as he realized what I did, and I could feel him fight to pull back, to stop me. But I held him tight, and anyway I knew he couldn't stop the desperate need of his lungs to expand, to survive, no matter what his forebrain thought it wanted.

In moments, it was done. I was empty, and he was full. 

He would live. He would be the one who made it.

I pulled back, and as I did the water exploded around us like it had come to life, gone in a snap from still to carbonated. All around us the architecture groaned, flexed, heaved, like it too had come alive.

Across the gap of thrumming water behind us I saw the glass door we'd come through pull back. Its dimensions and the reflection of my glowstick grew smaller.

The wall was pulling away.

Desperate, my own need to breathe becoming overwhelming, I faced forward again and tugged the glass door beside us open; but even as I did, Downstairs expanded. {downstairs growing} New glass doors spawned above us, below us, to every side. I ignored it all. I pulled the door open along its rail and grabbed Niko's arm to shove him through.

He gripped the edge as I did, twisting around to grasp my shoulder. There were no words for the look on his face, or for all the things we'd never said to each other and now never would. There was no time to say them and no air to say them with. I could guess what some of them would have been, maybe, but not others. There was so much of him I'd never really seen, never understood, too caught up in manufacturing other versions of him in my head to know the only one who'd really been there{maybe really there possible bit}. Now I'd never know how much I'd missed. 

I pulled back gently from his grasping hand, and smiled, and tried to put everything left I wanted to say into that.

Water frothed around us, twisting, expanding. And then in a flash it began to move. A current tore him from me, limbs flailing, pulling him backward through the mudroom and down the twin of the hall we'd swum through to get here, toward the other hatch. I hoped. Toward the right surface. Even if I'd wanted to follow, I couldn't have: another current of shockingly cold water had wrapped itself around me like a tendril. An angry, biotic undertow pulled me down, straight down, with vicious force. The reflection of my glowstick strobed as the current pulled me past door after door of sliding glass, faster and faster: a flicker, then a dull throb, fading and mingling with the phantom patterns and flashes of color now dancing across my vision as my oxygen-starved brain began to shut down. 

In a moment I'd breathe in, and I wondered what it would be like to inhale those waters of possibility, let that multiplying spring inside me. Let it fill me up. I harbored no illusions, of course: I'd seen it happen to the other Ryan. I'd die. But a beautiful way to go, in the abstract at least. A life spent worrying about possibilities would end by drowning in them. Neat.

This peaceful thought had so taken me I was caught utterly by surprise when the current shifted and smashed me into a pane of glass with so much force it shattered. Rocketing through a waterlogged hall of turbulent water, surrounded by tumbling fragments of glass, head throbbing and vision expiring, I opened my mouth in shock and, before I could remember I was waiting for a poetic moment to die, breathed in.

|

I surged forward, swimming hard, a savage rictus of victory splitting my face, and then with a crunch and flash of pain I slammed face-first into something hard and smooth. Glass. The door on the opposite side.

Seeing stars, tasting blood, I scrabbled for the handle, but I couldn't find it. My hands slid off smooth glass in every direction. I smeared them across it frantically, up, down, side to side, kicking out with my feet, conscious every second of those things behind me, turning, drifting back towards me, closing in; of the air in my lungs, running low. Running out. 

There: the handle. I pulled it sideways, and as the door slid open in its groove my glowstick came back on, the most glorious shade of {color4} you could possibly imagine.

I kicked forward into the other anteroom and pulled the door shut behind me, not looking back. There was no sign of the things, the {double things}, the echoes, whatever they were. I'd escaped them. My face throbbed with a sharp, spreading pain. But I had a bigger problem. In fact with lightheaded desperation I realized I was in deep, deep shit.

My air was almost gone. I'd lost some panicking, and my muscles burned through the rest as I shot myself through the airlock. An urge to breathe was taking hold of me, a tingling thrum running through my body as cells clamored for air. My lungs were empty. I couldn't swim again the distance I'd come, either forward or back.

Ahead of me, down the mirror-tunnel toward the other hatch and the other junction room, a deep {color4} light burned, brightening. The reflected light from another glowstick.

I watched myself swim into the room, holding it.

Amidst all the panicked horror and desperation, I hadn't noticed the wrongness creep up on me, but now I realized that sick feeling had been there all along, getting stronger, flavoring my more pressing concerns. This wasn't one of the things, I realized. It was me. My double, from the other side.

We were passing each other, as planned. But the plan had failed.

We stared at each other and both realized I wasn't going to make it.

Blood diffused from my nose in billowing red clouds; the cut on my leg burned a deep, dangerous ache. My torn fingernails stung where I'd clawed at the door. I was damaged, flawed. The worse-off copy. Looking at him, unharmed, whole, I accepted that I was about to die. It was surprisingly easy. 

He tilted his head, studying me. As if considering something. Or trying to see me, really see me, like I'd tried so many times to see Niko. 

{i/Do it}, I thought, {i/I’m too broken to make it. Go back. Or go forward. Just go. Live. Be the one who lives.}

His expression changed. Just a little.

And then he launched himself at me. At once the sense of wrongness spiked, as if approaching some exponential maxima. His face winced at this in exact sympathy with mine, but he didn't pull up, slow down. Instead he crashed right into me, hard. Tumbling, he wrapped his arms around me, held me, did the last thing I'd have ever expected.

He pushed his mouth to mine, and flooded my lungs with his air.

The wrongness had reached an unbearable threshold. But as his lips touched mine the sensation exploded outward, like magnets pushed against repelling poles till they slip from your fingers, flip around, snap into place. The water quivered around us; the room groaned, launching wet clouds of mud from splintering lintels, sending subsonic shockwaves shuddering through us. His breath flowed into me. I couldn't think, let alone protest or react. Boots tumbled around us, long laces waving like antennae. I remember that.

And then he was empty, and I was full.

He pulled back, blinked, smiled a smile I knew from the mirror. It meant {i/Oh, well, what you gonna do}.

He'd picked me.

A huge rumbling crack broke over the growing crescendo of rumbles and groans, and we both looked up. The ceiling had split in a long ugly scar. But the room wasn't collapsing on us. The split filled in almost immediately with new plaster, just as a different split bisected it, which also instantly filled.

The room was getting bigger.

My double grabbed my elbow, pushed me toward the hall he'd come in through, the way to the hatch to the other world, my world. And I started to swim. I shouldn't have. I should have thanked him. I should have given back half his air, or dragged him after me, found some way to save him. I should have died. But I didn't. I swam. I swam with everything I had left.

He'd made a mistake. Bet on the wrong horse. But I wouldn't forget it. I wouldn’t forget him.

All around me the architecture was groaning, flexing, like something waking up. {downstairs growing} I swam past a crack that didn't fill in but puckered into a new doorway, a flap of wallpaper lengthening and hardening into door. New doorways were spawning all around me; new pits gaped open in the floor. I ignored it all. I swam. I swam for my fucking life.

The guide rope, taut as a bowstring, snapped, whipping past my face as its two endpoints pulled away from each other. It didn't matter. I knew the way.

I swam into the mirror bathroom, shiny new sinks sprouting on the floor, on the ceiling; the toilet multiplying and splitting in porcelain osmosis, someone's pretentious art project. I swam up to the ceiling---already much higher than a bathroom ceiling should be---put my hands on the wheel of the hatch, and turned.

It didn't budge. 

The groaning rumbles of hell surrounded me, my body was once again starting to tingle as my second lungful of air reached its end, my face throbbed and my leg was on fire, and the wheel wouldn't turn.

I pounded on the hatch, screaming in fury, the sound utterly lost in the cacophonous eruption of architecture beneath me.

I braced myself, gripped the wheel so hard I thought my knuckles would pop, pulled on it with everything I had.

Then I tried turning it the other direction, and the wheel spun.

I yanked it around, then forced myself up against the hatch, lungs burning, kicking hard, and pushed and swung it up and open, and then I was through, breaking the surface. I breathed, huge and deep. 

Then I coughed. Clutching the sides of the hatch, I coughed, blinked, tried to take stock of this new hexagonal room. A huge crack had opened in the floor, and all the water had drained out. The groaning and clanging was sharper up here, out of the water, but mostly coming from beneath.

I pulled myself out of the raised pillar and tumbled to the bucking ground, wiped blood from my face. I was gasping, coughing, bleeding, hurting, panicking, and also, somehow, living. Deservedly or not.

Piled on the lip of one of the tunnels out were a pair of shoes and a dry, folded t-shirt.

An ear-splitting crack rang off the walls. Bricks fell from the ceiling in a deadly shower, landing a dozen feet away. I grabbed the shirt and pulled it on over my wet torso, slipped the shoes over numb and wrinkled feet. The ground heaved beneath me like the back of a whale taking a colossal breath before diving deep, and as it did it swallowed up the bricks, incorporated them neatly into itself like a child's plastic puzzle pieces falling into matching slots.

The floor of the bathroom, through the open hatch, was gone. Tile walls descended, vanishing into darkness. They were splitting and rejoining, like some fractal screensaver, an optical illusion in constant motion from the corner of your eye but damnably still if you looked right at it.

Something was broken. Something had diverged too far. There were too many possibilities and they couldn't all fit. They needed more room.

Time, I decided, to get the hell out.

With a great belching snap, the floor punctured upwards and a spout of cloudy water billowed up. Another spout exploded from the other side of the room. I picked one of the circular tunnels and started running down it, as fast as I could on my hobbled leg, while behind me the depths of Downstairs sloughed and squirmed into new permutations, unseen. I was too busy living to look back.
