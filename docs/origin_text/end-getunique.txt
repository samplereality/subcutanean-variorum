{endmatter/Get Your Own Unique Copy}

{i/Subcutanean} is a permutational novel: the text can be rendered in millions of different ways. This was a fixed copy generated for sale on traditional platforms, but your purchase entitles you to your own free digital copy with a unique seed number that will never be re-used. Your unique copy will contain a slightly different version of the story: words, sentences, even entire scenes may appear there that don't appear in this version.

To get your unique copy, send an email to: {b/AUTHOREMAIL} with this passphrase: {i/the wolf is real}. You'll receive your version as a Kindle-compatible .mobi file, unless you request a different format: PDF, .epub, Markdown, or plain text versions are also available.

You can also find out how to get a paperback copy with a unique seed by visiting the project's website at {b/subcutanean.textories.com}.
