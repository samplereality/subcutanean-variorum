[Before long the floor began to change|Soon the texture of the ground beneath my feet started to vary][ in frequent, abrupt transitions]. First it went glossy-smooth, then to shag, then to changing patterns and textures of creaking wood, tile, and carpet. I stumbled more and more over bumps and irregularities, as if the floor was crumpling, bunching up as we neared some pressure point.

Niko opened every door we passed now. At the third one after we slowed down, he sucked in a sharp breath.

“Definitely on the right track. You're gonna need eyes for this, kiddo.” He pulled my blindfold free.

I blinked in the sudden glare from his light. He stood between me and the open doorway at the end of the hall. It was dark inside[@ffthewalls> and cold damp air spilled out; |, though] I could see something [@ffchandelier>glittering in the gloom behind him. Ice?|piled up jumbled in the gloom behind him. Bricks?]

“Take a look,” he said with a grin. “I'll shine the light. But don't lean too far in. I wouldn't bet your life on my grip on the rope.”

Wondering what he meant, I shuffled to the doorframe. He turned and shined the light past me, and that's when the vertigo hit.

[@ffdropoff>The door opened onto nothing. Past the frame, the floor dropped away into blackness. The flashlight only went so far, of course, so I shouldn't have been able to tell how far down the drop-off went.

Except I could.

Far, far below us were tiny clusters of lights. Irregularly spaced, but stretching out in all directions. Maybe miles down. It was like the view out the window of a red-eye, flying over suburbia at night.

That wasn't what gave me the vertigo.

|@ffthewalls>The door opened onto a drop-off. The opposite wall was distant but visible at the edge of our light, so couldn't have been more than a hundred feet away. But the floor and ceiling were gone. Past the doorframe, the wall plunged up and down into limitless blackness. Turning my head carefully to the left and right, I could see the walls also extended into dim infinity in either direction. We were peeking out the side of a canyon that seemed to stretch on forever: up, down, left, and right.

The walls were pink and pillowy. For a queasy moment they looked like skin, until I realized what they actually were. Fiberglass. The endless walls stretching into the gloom were pink insulation foam, divided by rectangular grids of dusty wood, marked here and there with pencil marks and marred by chipped, discolored edges. We were termites in the walls of a giant's house.

Here and there, other open doorways interrupted the endless pink sea of insulation. Streams of water spilled from some, cascading down into an inky depth that gave back no hint of answering splash. Cascades plunged down from above us, too. The space was filled with a cold and heavy mist.
]

Curving down from the base of the doorway was [@ffchandelier>a filigreed structure I couldn't at first identify. My impression of ice was wrong: it was laid out more like a spiderweb, a grid of sparkly intersecting lines. As I squinted I realized the sparkles were countless tiny crystals, dangling from some kind of mesh and reflecting back the flashlight in hundreds of shimmering glints. As the web curved down and away it grew denser and denser, strands converging towards a point maybe sixty feet below and another sixty away from the door. The lines of dangling crystal converged there into a dense, scintillating object a couple feet across.|a complex, multi-colored structure I couldn't at first identify. My impression of bricks was wrong, I realized. They were books. A mounded pathway of them: a ribbon of books and long flat pieces of wood, jumbled up like after an earthquake, curving down and away towards a point maybe sixty feet below and another sixty from the door. The chaos converged there into a tall rectangular object, where the sheets of wood became flat and level, interspersed with neat rows of books.]

A {path object}. I blinked. [@ffchandelier>It hung with no obvious point of support above|It sat on] a [@ffset>square platform suspended beneath us in mid-air|long narrow platform covered in junk]. It was as if the {path object} had exploded, but only in one direction, toward us: [@ffchandelier>crystals|books and shelves] multiplying and propagating outward and upward in an ever-widening wave of fractal repetition, connecting the {path object} to our hallway with a web of [@ffchandelier>glass|itselfness].
[MACRO path object][@ffchandelier>chandelier|bookcase]

“It's a Confusion,” Niko said with a satisfied grin. “Means we're real close now.”

“A what?” I backed away from the horrifying drop-off.

“What I call them.” He shrugged. “Most of Downstairs tends to follow normal architectural rules. Walls, floor, ceiling, measurements more or less what you'd expect. Bedroom objects in bedrooms.” He played his light along the [@ffchandelier>chandelier-net, watching its cut-glass facets sparkle|path of books, embossed titles and snatches of cover art bouncing it back]. “But close to a connection point, things get jumbled up. [@ffthewalls>Perspectives change. Architecture gets stretched to breaking.] Like it's harder to maintain the semblance of order, for some reason.”

I thought of our fridge, in a kitchen with a pool that had a door at the bottom.

“This one,” he added, frowning down, “is pretty fucking weird, though.”

Still struggling with vertigo (tipping forward, arms bound, unable to stop myself as I [@ffchandelier>crashed through the flimsy web|plummeted past that cloud of books] and tumbled [@ffdropoff>into blackness|down that bottomless canyon]) I followed his gaze. The [@ffchandelier>lines of chandelier|stream of book]-stuff converged [@ffchandelier>above|at] what I'd at first seen as [@ffset>a square platform some way below and in front of us. But as I focused on it, I realized it wasn't a platform, but a set. {pp} Only its base was solid, a room-sized square suspended in midair over that awful drop. Thin metal poles sketched out the cube whose floor was defined by the platform, and wires arced up from the cube's top corners and down from its bottom ones into the distance, anchoring it in place. A set, like I said: my first impression was that I was looking down on some ambitious experimental theater production.|a narrow strip of ground some way below and in front of us, itself suspended over that awful drop. But as I focused on the strip of ground, I realized it wasn't a flat surface, but something more complex: a sort of huge tube or pipe, maybe thirty feet thick, stretching away in both directions. {tube description details}]

[MACRO tube description details][@ffdropoff>It made slow, lazy curves as it went, like an immense statue of a snake slithering through grass. You could walk flat along the top of the snake's {tdd_final}|It ran straight as an arrow, like some immense piece of plumbing running through the wall.

[MACRO tdd_final][~back in either direction, assuming you could get down there in the first place. Its endpoints, if any, were lost in darkness.]

And it got weirder.

The [@ffset>floor of the set|tube] appeared to be [@ffset>|made of] the same scuffed, dusty hardwood floor tiles as my bedroom. [@ffset>Tatty throw rugs, dollar-store trash cans, secondhand furniture, and a battered desk filled up the floor space, haphazard: none exactly like the things in my room, but close, as if out of the same catalog, the same tile set. Pictures and mirrors hung suspended on wires where the nonexistent walls should have been; in the latticework above, artfully positioned spotlights shone down, making the stage gleam bright in the gloom.|A profusion of tatty throw rugs clung flat to its surface even on the curving sides, like stickers on a tipped-over water bottle. And a motley collection of bedroom furniture was scattered all around it, also attached in some gravity-defying way to the curved surface. No matter the angle, the furniture rose from the hardwood tube as if down was towards its center. A dresser canted at a forty-five degree angle; the top of a bookshelf poked up around the edge of the curve, like peering over the horizon of a tiny planet.] So yeah, picture looking down at [@ffset>{set overview}|{tube overview}] And all suspended over a [@ffdropoff>miles-high drop down|drop-off] to god knows where, [@ffthewalls>surrounded by endless walls of pink insulation foam, ]connected to us via [@ffchandelier>exploded rays of chandelier|an exploded pathway of library].

“Holy shit,” I said.

He laughed. “Damn straight. Okay then. Who wants to go first?”

{section_break}

It was me. Surprise. Niko realized he'd have to untie my hands for me to climb down, and if he went first, there'd be nothing to stop me running off back the way we'd come. I'd be running in the wrong direction, away from the supposed portal back to my own side, but I felt like that might be preferable to being the prisoner of a hungry psychopath who looked like a strung-out version of my dead best friend. [Or whatever we were to each other.]

[@ffset>Not that it was apparent the floating platform was anything but a dead end. I protested weakly, but he was firm: {set egress plan} He|Of course, if I went first there'd be nothing to stop me running off along the impossible bedroom-tube, either. Except I'd have exactly two directions to choose from and Niko would have a birds-eye view on which one I picked. Academic, anyway: he] retied the rope around my ankle, let out enough slack for me to get down, and wound the other end around the doorknob of the last room back, a few paces up the hall.

[MACRO set egress plan][@ffthewalls>“We can swing across from there to one of the hallways on the other side. No problemo.”|“The path goes through there. Looks like a dead end from up here but there'll be something when we get down. Some way forward. You'll see.”]

“This probably won't hold your weight,” he added, tugging the rope experimentally. “Not for long anyway. But if I brace myself and take some of the load, it should be enough.”

He explained the plan while sliding fresh batteries into a headlamp and tightening it onto my head: I would climb down the [@ffchandelier>chandelier net|ribbon of books and shelving] while he and the doorknob stood ready to catch me if I fell. When I got to [@ffset>{set locale desc}|{tube locale desc}]he'd retie the rope to himself, and follow me down while I braced from below. He reminded me that since we'd be tied together, catching him if he fell would be in our mutual interest.
[MACRO tube locale desc][@ffdropoff>the top of the tube-path---the back of the snake---|the top of the tube-path, ]
[MACRO set locale desc][~the floating set, ]

He also mentioned, quite casually, that he had no plans to kill me. Our deal held. Once I got him to the surface, he'd vanish and I'd never see him again. If I messed with him, though---tried to untie my rope while down there and run off, or got funny ideas about yanking it---he would hunt me down. He told me of his expertise at hunting me down---me, personally. He'd done it dozens of times. He'd know which way I'd choose at intersections. Where I'd try to hide. 

And once he found me, he'd hurt me. He'd spend a long time hurting me.

He was an expert at that too, he said.

As if to illustrate this point he pulled out a camping knife with a long, serrated blade and flipped it open: the kind you'd use to saw through small deadwood to make tinder. We'd looked at one just like it at the sporting goods store, my Niko and I, but decided not to get it. After admiring it for a moment, he closed it and attached it to his belt. I wondered if this was less a threat than insurance against being tied together above a gut-clenching drop. Maybe some of each.

He watched me watching the knife, with cut-glass intensity.

“Time to go,” he said.

I clutched the doorjamb, trying not to stare down at [@ffdropoff>the twinkling lights far below|the bottomless canyon past the edge of the carpet]. Trying to think of some way to get out of this.

“What do you think's down there?” I asked, buying time.

He didn't look up, focused on a knot. [@ffdropoff>“I think we're above {what we're above}{justification for lights}”|@ffthewalls>“Water,” he said. “Everything ends in water down here. Or maybe we're above {what we're above} Sometimes there's smashed-up stuff down there. Ruined furniture, shattered light bulbs with tangled-up cords. Maybe this is where it comes from.”]

He pulled the cinch tight. “[Found a couple smashed-up Ryans and Nikos down there, too. Never understood what happened to them, before. Try to be careful, buddy.|Rules of geometry don't really make sense this deep, though. Maybe we're already below {what we're above short}. Maybe this goes down forever.{maybe stars}]”
[MACRO maybe stars][25> Maybe those lights are stars.]

[MACRO what we're above][@TheCity>the City. With all the houses, like I told you.|the Basement. The soil, like I told you. The bottom.]
[MACRO what we're above short][@TheCity>the City|the Basement]

# The City has been established as having sources of light, so the biggest thing to explain is how Niko knows we're above it. If it's the Basement, though, we need to justify why there are lights below.
[MACRO justification for lights][@TheCity> From down there you sometimes see clusters of lights, way up above. This must be one of them.|” {pp} “And... those lights?” {pp} “You find lit-up stuff down there, sometimes.” He sounded bored. “Little pools of light. Oases. A pile of blazing floor lamps, jumbled together like they're having an orgy. Wrist-thick tangles of power cords snaking off into the dark. Found a ball of wadded up Christmas lights once. Twenty feet across. All blinking.]

He got to his feet, wincing and putting a hand momentarily to his temples. “Okay, quit stalling. Get moving.”

“Hang on.” Fear sweated out of me. “We don't even know if this [@ffchandelier>mesh or net or whatever|book path thing] will hold my weight. Or if this portal you're looking for is even down there.”

“It's down there.” He set his grip on the rope. “I'm sure of that. But as for your first concern...”

He shrugged, then shoved me, hard.

I flailed, but my body was already past the edge of the door, my hands too slow to grab the frame, world tilting at a sickening angle. My sneaker tried to glue itself to the carpet of the hall but my center of mass was too far out, way too far. My head dropped below my feet and I opened my mouth to scream as I began to fall into nothingness.

{section_break}

[*Ch14Pathway*@ffchandelier>With a tinkling smash, I crashed into the net of chandelier. It was like landing on an uncomfortably studded trampoline, sloped sharply down. For a second everything swayed, nauseating, and I scrambled for a grip, but I was slipping, sliding over the scraping glass baubles, down and sideways towards the edge...

With a whimper I clutched the mesh beneath me, wrapping my hands around faceted glass and wire and jamming my feet into gaps. One leg was dangling out into the yawning void of empty space, but my other three limbs were all caught. I jerked to a stop, gasping, swaying, heart pounding so hard I could barely think, spread-eagled like a fly in a tacky, glittering web.

{somewhere above Niko laughed} center of the jangling net. Moving was awkward: the mesh was a grid of thin metal wire, squares maybe eight or nine inches apart up here, but denser farther down. Little glass baubles dangled from it every few inches, sparkling in the beam of my headlamp. The thing was not comfortable to crawl on, and had enough give that it deformed alarmingly as I shifted my weight. The thin mesh cut into my hands unless I was careful; I'd scraped them both, stopping myself from falling.
|@ffbookshelves>With a muffled {i/whump}, I crashed into the mountain of books. It would have been like falling onto a lumpy, moss-covered slope, except for the edges of shelves biting into my back. For a second I slowed, a faint cloud of dust and wood pulp rising around me, and then I started to slide.

With a whimper I grabbed for a handhold and ripped off the cover of a Stephen King paperback. I was picking up speed, scraping and slipping down a slope that was murderously steep, dislodging books that slid away and tumbled down into nothingness. Frantic, I jammed my hands into gaps between them, dug in my left foot. My right was dangling out into the void, but my other three limbs, thank god, were enough to stop me. I gasped, inhaling book dust, heart pounding, and wondered idly if Borges had ever had this particular nightmare.

{somewhere above Niko laughed} flatter middle of the book-path. I was close enough to get a good look now, and recognized a lot of titles. Sci-fi paperbacks, biology textbooks, graphic novels, biographies of composers. Some of them were books from my own bookshelf, and the rest would have been plausible to find there. Tens of thousands of them. They seemed to be stuck together with something like glue: strong enough for the slope to keep its basic shape, but not strong enough to feel safe trusting your grip to.
]
[MACRO somewhere above Niko laughed][~From somewhere above, Niko laughed. “See!” he called down. “Speculate, theorize all you want. Only way to get answers is to dive in head first. Or butt first, in your case.” He let out some slack in the rope. “Now untwist your panties and get climbing.”

I wriggled away from the unthinkable drop-off, back toward the]

I looked back up. [@ffdropoff>There was no wall around the hall we'd come through to get here. It stretched back into empty space beyond the limits of my light, wreathed in billowing pink insulation. Huge lumps swelled from the sides, also swaddled in pink: presumably the last few rooms we'd passed. It looked like a long pink tongue, thick with diseased bumps, that we'd wriggled to the end of and crawled out the tip.{pp}|The hall we'd arrived from was one of a handful interrupting the expanse of smooth pink insulation, but water poured from each of the others, and there was no obvious way to reach any of them. ]
Shuddering, I looked down along the path of books, scouting my route to the relative safety of the [@ffset>floating set|impossible bedroom's curving surface]. The steep slope [@ffchandelier>of the net up here flattened as it dropped and converged to chandelier|flattened as the path dropped and converged to bookcase]. I decided facing the [@ffchandelier>net|books] and right-side up was the safest position to start, like [@ffchandelier>climbing down a ladder|descending an especially literate climbing wall]. When the thing became more horizontal, I'd have to twist around and crawl, then drop the last few feet to the [@ffset>platform|top of the tube].

It was awkward and slow going, in part because I took significantly more care than I strictly needed. I did not want to trust my life to that murderous asshole and a fucking doorknob[@ffbookshelves>, or to the integrity of a yellowing {AnotherAuthor} paperback].

[MACRO tube or set][@ffset>set|tube]
[MACRO cylinder or platform][@ffset>platform|cylinder]
One handhold and foothold at a time (and ignoring Niko's frequent insults and urgings to hurry the fuck up) I finally made it to the {path object} proper, which [@ffchandelier>I noticed, disconcertingly, wasn't connected to anything at all. Nevertheless, it was rock-solid, anchored with implacable tenacity to its chosen point in space, hovering above the top of the {tube or set} beneath, as if hanging from the ceiling of an ordinary room.

Carefully, I pushed my feet over the tinkling edge and dropped the few feet to the {curving if tube} hardwood beneath me.

I landed hard and dropped into a crouch, adrenaline flaring.|stood innocently on the {tube or set top}. The books and shelves converged into order as if by magic, like every few inches down were another frame of an explosion played in reverse.

I clambered down the last few shelves and stepped onto the dusty wooden floor, unclenching hands rubbed raw and scraped with paper cuts.] While nice to be off the [@ffchandelier>chandelier net|ribbon of books], this felt only slightly less precarious. [@ffset>The platform swayed with my momentum: slight, but enough to suggest how thin the wires were that held it suspended, how unknown the strength of their theoretical anchor points, lost in shadow. I kept away from the edges, which confined me to a small square in the platform's center. {pp} I eyed the bed with suspicious curiosity, but on closer inspection it looked nothing like my own. It was a bulky thing with a built-in headboard shelf, and showed no signs of having the ability to swing open.|The very top of the huge tube was level enough, but the edges curved down on both sides with alarming speed. The zone where I felt comfortable standing was a rounded summit only five or six feet wide; after that, the slope got steeper and steeper. {pp} Looking down the length of the tube, the flat zone of safety stretched {forward curved or straight}, but in no way a clear one. To navigate it, you'd have to clamber over beds, edge vertiginously around angled desks. It was as if all the furniture was bolted to that cylindrical floor. Turning toward the sickening curve of the drop-off and seeing the tops of bedroom junk poking up from beyond the horizon a few feet away, I again couldn't shake the sense I was on a tiny planet furnished out of the IKEA catalogue and the dregs of garage sales, albeit one stretched from a sphere into an infinitely long cylinder. {pp} Experimentally, I took a few steps curveward, wondering if gravity somehow worked differently here; but it didn't seem to, at least not for me. The angle felt steep and dangerous. My own “down” was still toward {my own down}. Whether the furniture really was bolted to the floor or just obeying its own special rules would have to remain a mystery.]

I finally remembered Niko, who'd stopped berating me some time ago, and glanced up to see what he was doing. He wasn't there. I frowned. The rope tied to my ankle curved up to the lip of the hall, tracing the path of the [@ffchandelier>chandelier-net|books], and vanished inside. I was so far below the hallway now I could only see a few feet of walls and ceiling through its open door. The corridor still seemed lit by the refracted glow of a flashlight, moving around somewhere back there, so I figured he hadn't gone far. Maybe he was untying the rope from the doorknob and tying it to himself, so he could follow me down. But he'd been at it a while.

{i/Shit.} This was an opportunity, and I was squandering it. I glanced down at the rope tied to my ankle, but there were multiple knots, some kind of Navy-ass shit, pulled so tight my foot was losing circulation. Sharp. I needed something sharp. I cast around desperately. A few paces from me was a nightstand with drawers, and I yanked one open, hoping for---I don't know. Something. Anything. But there was only junk inside: a few dusty paperclips, a mechanical pencil with a missing eraser. A single red prize ticket from a skeeball alley.

I stared at it, despair creeping over me.

Light played across my face. I started and looked up, guilty. Niko was back, peering down distractedly from the [@ffdropoff>hanging] doorway, the rope now tied around his waist. [@ffset>The shadows from the wires and cables that held the set suspended played across my face like strands of spiderweb.] He didn't seem to notice what I was doing. He seemed on edge.

“I think there's one of those fucking {double things} up here,” he said. “Way, way back in the hall. At the edge of my light. Doesn't matter. Not going back that way, are we? I'm coming down. Find something to brace yourself on. Brace good and tight,” he added, “because if I fall and you're not secure, you're coming with me, baby.”

Maybe that would be preferable, the best fate for all concerned.

But maybe he was telling the truth. Maybe he really wasn't planning to kill me. Maybe there was a door up ahead for my key. A way back.

{i/Without Niko?}

My survival instinct shoved the thought away, like a drowner pushing their rescuer down into the choking depths, desperate to keep their own head above water.

[@ffset>I cast around for something heavy, but the set's furnishings were as accurately cheap as its upstairs inspiration: more particle-board than heavy oak, plastic trash cans but no sturdy hope chests. I kicked one scraped-up dresser with my foot, and it obligingly slid a few inches across the floor.

“Bracing myself might be a problem,”|{tube bracing}]
[MACRO tube bracing][@fftubeweird>I looked for a way to brace myself, and that's when I discovered the furniture wasn't bolted to the floor.

If you gave it a shove, it slid, like normal furniture. But as I inadvertently shoved an armoire two feet farther towards the curve, I hopped back, expecting gravity and momentum to pull the top-heavy thing down and around the slope till it fell over the edge and plummeted into blackness.

Instead, it slid a few feet and then stopped, tilted at a dizzying angle but perfectly content where it was.

Frowning, afraid to get too close, I reached out with my foot and gave it a solid kick. It slid another foot around the curve, angle steepening towards a ridiculous thirty-five or forty degrees. But it showed no signs of toppling over. It acted, in fact, exactly as if I was shoving it over flat ground.

“Bracing myself might be a problem,”|I looked for a way to brace myself, and that's when I discovered the furniture {i/was} bolted to the floor. Whether on the top of the curve or sticking horizontally out of its side, it was all attached with thick steel bolts at every contact point to the ground, even the plastic trash cans. None of it budged an inch even when I put my whole back into trying to move it.

“Bracing shouldn't be a problem,”] I shouted up, but there was no response. I figured he hadn't heard---the [@ffthewalls>forest of insulation|empty space] around us swallowed up sound, creating a surreal distance to everything, like someone had turned down the volume on reality---but when I looked up to shout, Niko was staring back down the hallway behind him again.

“I think it got closer.” He glanced down at me for a moment, face unreadable, then looked back down the hall. “While I wasn't looking. Fucking creepy. In fact…” He trailed off, staring at something I couldn't see. My vantage point only showed a couple feet of ceiling.

“What?” My stomach churned, as if in warning.

He didn't look away from whatever he was staring at.

“It's got something in its hand,” he said, quite calmly.

Nausea swept through me, chemical fear. Hairs prickled all over my body.

“It's coming toward me, Ry.” He was still calm, still staring down the hall. “I'm starting down in twenty seconds. [@fftube>Tie the rope around something.|Figure out a way to brace yourself.] Fast.”

Maybe he was messing with me again. Trying to put the fear of god in me so I'd hurry it up.

Or maybe he wasn't. I knew what his calm tone meant. What he hid behind it. He was fucking terrified.

“I've never seen one move like this,” he said, voice still calm. “It's running down the hall towards me, now. Ryan. Hurry.”

Something inside me screamed. {i/He's not lying and something is coming and there's nowhere to run and maybe I should let it get him but I'm tied to him I'm fucking tied---}

I ripped my gaze from the [@ffdropoff>floating] hall and cast frantically around the narrow [@ffset>square|path] of safety for [@ffset>something sturdy|something secure, anything heavy]. [@ffset>The big bed with its|There: a bulky bed with a bookcase] headboard filled with [@ffchandelier>books and] knick-knacks[@ffset> looked the heaviest].

[@fftube>|Quickly I did it again, wrapping the rope twice around {scramble again end}. If Niko fell now, all that weight plus my own should be enough to hold him.]
[MACRO scramble again end][@ffset>the furniture's bulk|@fftubeweird>the heavy furniture]

“Hurry up,” he shouted from above, still staring down the hall, and then {i/I could hear it}. Footsteps, beating against the carpet. Something running down the hallway, running flat out. A manic run. Fast. As fast as it could.

“Ready,” I shouted up, not sure which side to root for, not sure of anything but the pulse hammering in my ears.

He nodded once, then pulled his gaze away and swung out over the edge, flipping around to face the [@ffchandelier>net|book-slope], feet feeling for purchase while he clutched the end of the carpet. Focusing on his hands, not glancing down the hall again, he started down. His descent was much quicker than mine, efficient and smooth. But still not fast enough.

It was coming for him. The footsteps thudded the hall above, creaked loose floorboards. They were close.

“Shit,” he said. “Shit shit shit.” He was still close to the doorway. Too close. 

{i/What is it what does it want why is it running what does it have in its...}

With shocking suddenness a hand wrapped itself around the doorframe. It gripped it tight as a body appeared behind it, skidding on the carpet, coming to a halt on the edge of the drop-off. I shivered as I saw it, every part of me shocked into motion like I'd leapt into an ice-cold stream. I wanted to scream but couldn't. My gaze was fixed on the thing in the doorway.

And then I recognized its face.

It was Niko. Young again.

{i/My Niko[.|?]}

He raised his hand and shot his older clone with my gun.

But even as he did[ something {i/changed} around us. The {tube or set} rippled beneath my feet, writhing, flexing. {ch14 expansion bit}

Downstairs was growing larger.

I looked back up. The bullet had gone wide as both Nikos had grabbed for support in the sudden groaning sway. But now younger Niko was lifting the gun again while Elder scrabbled|, Elder Niko was throwing himself to the side, scrabbling] for [@ffchandelier>purchase on the jangling net|handholds of musty paper] ({i/and it can't be my gun}, I thought distantly, {i/no more bullets}) and younger Niko changed his aim, steadied himself; but Elder snarled, leapt back up four feet of [@ffchandelier>net|books] in a frantic bound, and wrapped his arms around his double's lower legs, hanging his whole weight on them; and younger Niko's knees buckled and he tumbled forward onto the [@ffchandelier>net|slope] with a cry. 
[MACRO ch14 expansion bit][@ffdropoff>Far below the {expansion lights explanation}; new lights winked on in the emptiness between them.|The endless canyon of pink insulation around us groaned and stretched, pulled away, growing dimmer in the scattered light of our headlamps. New grid lines appeared as the wood reconfigured itself.]
[MACRO expansion lights explanation][@TheCity>lights of the city seemed to drop, expand|scattered lights seemed to stretch, expand]

Or maybe it was me who cried out, I wasn't sure, and I couldn't breathe, because both Nikos were snarling, scrambling for purchase on each other, on the gun, on the precarious [@ffchandelier>net|slope] beneath them as they tumbled down[ it][@ffbookshelves>, ripped-off pages fluttering in their wake]. They were seconds away from slipping off the side, from plunging into the void of empty space beneath us.

“Look out!” I shrieked, but young Niko had jammed his gun hand [@ffchandelier>through a gap in the net, jerking them both|into a gap between two hardbacks, jerking both Nikos] to a halt. [@ffchandelier>The web of chandelier-stuff bucked and heaved, tinkling like a dump truck full of glass. An eyebolt connecting it to the doorframe wrenched free with a splintering groan.|The pillar of books shuddered with crumbling pulpy sounds, a hundred rips and tears; a dozen volumes shook free and fell.] I felt the same crawling horror of watching a spider fight a scrabbling insect, vicious, instinctual. Elder Niko [@ffchandelier>plunged his hand through also to the underside of the net, wrestling for the gun. It|leapt a body length up the slope and grappled for his double's gun hand. The gun] went off again with a muffled thump, swallowed up by [@ffbookshelves>the books and] the [@ffdropoff>void|acres of insulation] around us. [@ffchandelier>Something zipped past my face in the same instant and I ducked, belatedly, eyes still glued on the fight above.]

Elder Niko lifted his other arm high and elbowed his double hard in the gut, but was met with a savage kick; he grunted and started sliding again, grasping at [@ffchandelier>the beads of glass|slippery covers] for purchase. Young Niko struggled to pull his gun arm [@ffchandelier>out of the net but all his weight was on it now and the wire frame dug into his skin|free but all his weight hung from it now and the collapsing books had closed on it like a vise]. Elder had grabbed his leg and was yanking on it; he kicked at the grasping hands, and as he did I remembered something vitally important.

“He's tied to me!” I screamed.

Elder laughed as Niko's eyes widened. “That's right, asshole,” he shouted. “If I go, your boyfriend goes.”

Niko bit his lip, recalculating[ (and I hated myself for handicapping him; maybe I deserved to fall)|,] and pushed himself higher with a grunt, yanking his arm free. But as he did the gun caught on [@ffchandelier>one of the glass baubles|a dust jacket], and before he could grab it the weapon was sliding and scraping down the [@ffchandelier>net|slope]. Toward the other Niko, who lunged for it, laughing.

In a clear mental flash I saw what would happen: he'd grab it, he'd shoot young Niko between the eyes; his face would go slack and he'd fall off the [@ffchandelier>net|edge] into the void and vanish, and it wasn't that I loved him or couldn't survive without him but something else, a pure flash of righteous indignant anger rising up in me. After coming back for me, after {i/rescuing} me, when he could and maybe should have left me behind, he didn't deserve to die like this.

Elder was stretched out precariously, hand only inches from the gun, and without thinking or planning I grabbed the rope trailing up to him and yanked it, with all the strength I had.

He let out a {i/whoof} as his torso lurched back, all the air forced out of him, and balanced for a heartbeat at a crazy angle, only one foot touching the [@ffchandelier>jangling net|confusion of books]. Then momentum pulled him backward, over the side, and he fell.

Everything happened very fast.

The gun [@ffchandelier>slipped through a gap in the net and tumbled|tumbled off the uneven edge and dropped away] into darkness.

Elder screamed in fury and grabbed for [@ffchandelier>the edge of the net. He caught it and the whole thing twisted; but he'd snagged only a single strand and it couldn't stop him. It shrugged him off, slicing the skin off his fingers, and he fell|the edge. He caught the corner of a thick hardback but it pulled free from the others, and he fell, still holding it], arms and legs flailing, trailing rope behind him.

[@ffchandelier>But his grab for the net had dislodged my Niko too, and he was head down and slipping, flailing, grasping, tangled up in Elder's rope.|But dislodging the book had kicked off an avalanche. More and more books were slipping free now, tumbling into nothing like a sand castle balanced on the edge of a crumbling cliff. My Niko scrambled up the slope like an ant in a sandtrap. Losing ground.]

All this happened faster than movement. Maybe my brain had sent signals to my muscles, but they hadn't arrived yet, or my body was too confused to interpret them.

Elder tumbled down, rope twisting behind him. He reached toward the {cylinder or platform}, but it was too far away; he was going to fall past it. [@ffset>He stretched instead for one of the taut cables holding it up but he was moving too fast{hand detail}|He stretched for a piece of furniture instead and collided with it, face scraping against the top of a sideways bureau; a spurt of blood exploded from his cheek even as he scrabbled to get a grip but he was moving too fast{weird tube drag around bit}], and he kept falling.
[MACRO hand detail][@ffchandelier>, couldn't close his fingers around its thinness fast enough; it twanged as he plucked it with an immense, groaning thrum|; it shrugged him off, slicing the skin off his fingers and twanging with a low, sharp-edged thrum]
[MACRO weird tube drag around bit][@fftubeweird> and was too heavy for its weight to stop him. His momentum pulled it a quarter-revolution around to the underside of the sphere and away from his grasp]

Above me, my Niko cursed [@ffchandelier>and slid off the edge of the net. The tangled rope had gone taut and yanked him off, and|and dove off the collapsing tube of books as it gave way beneath him, and then] he was falling too. [Only he wasn't tied to anything.|Only he wasn't tied onto a rope. He wasn't tied to anything.]

I finally moved, lurched forward to do something, anything. But Elder had fallen out of my sight line[@ffset>| around the curve], and his end of the rope tied to the bed I stood on snapped taut with a creak[@ffset>|, wrapping tight to the cylinder's curve]. 

Young Niko plunged by on the edge of my vision[@ffbookshelves> in a rain of paperbacks][@ffset>|, colliding with a piece of furniture and tumbling with it][@fftube>. Before I could think, before I could stop myself, I threw myself off the edge of the cylinder after him, arcing down into nothingness.|, but then the bed juddered and groaned underneath me. It started to slide, to pull me toward{optaround} the edge.

I realized I'd made a mistake.

I'd thought if someone fell, the stress on the rope would be basically downward. The weight of the bed{optarmoire}, especially with me on top, would act like an anchor. Surely enough to arrest a fall.

{ch14planfailexpl}

Elder's weight on the rope was pulling the bed not down but sideways, like a bodybuilder tugging it across a floor; and me with it. {weirdorsetfinal}] 

[MACRO optaround][@ffset>|, around,]
[MACRO optarmoire][@ffset>| and armoire]
[MACRO ch14planfailexpl][@ffset>But the rope came up over the edge of the platform and angled across the floor. The force on the bed was entirely from the side.|But I'd forgotten that down, for the bed---for everything in the Confusion but us---was relative.]
[MACRO weirdorsetfinal][@ffset>Toward the drop-off and the {what's beneath endch14}. Toward a drop there'd be no possible way to survive.|But this floor was curved. Imagine a magnetic ball bearing pulled around a sphere of iron. The force of Elder's weight on the rope was sliding the bed around the tube towards the bottom.

But the tube's magic gravity didn't work on me. My down was toward the {what's beneath endch14}. I was starting down the hill of a roller coaster without a seatbelt, and the hill wrapped past the vertical.]
[MACRO what's beneath endch14][@ffdropoff>{what's beneath dropoff endch14}, miles below|infinite canyon below]
[MACRO what's beneath dropoff endch14][@TheCity>lights of the city of houses|unseen dirt of the Basement]

[@ffset>I moved faster than thought. I'd never considered myself a person with quick reflexes, someone you could count on in a crisis. But before I consciously knew why I was doing it I'd flung myself off the bed and was racing across the platform towards the opposite side. Behind me I could hear the bed's juddering accelerate as Elder's weight tugged it even faster across the floor. {maybedepositjoke} I had only seconds before it reached the edge.

Before I could change my mind, I leapt off the platform, arcing down into nothingness.]
