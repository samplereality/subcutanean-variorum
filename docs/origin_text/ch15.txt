{chapter/15}

[@fftube>I'd never skydived or bungee jumped before; I had no experience with free fall and barely any even with contact sports. My angle was wrong. I realized this as my foot left the wood of the cylinder, realized there was no way to correct my course. I'd shoved off at too steep an angle. I was going to fall beneath him.

Desperate, I reached my hand up, but he was one step ahead of me. He couldn't reach me, but grabbed for the rope trailing behind me, tied to my ankle. Then it went taut and {rope jerks to stop}. 

|@ffset>I fell for only a second before {rope jerks to stop}.

|@fftubeweird>Already I was at a forty-five-degree angle and steepening as the bed groaned and juddered across the floor, leaving deep gouges in the hardwood. {maybedepositjoke} I sprang up the steepening slope of mattress, toward the receding safety of the top of the bedroom-tube; but the bed crashed into some other piece of furniture and we jerked sideways, and I cried out and dived for the headboard as the angle approached vertical.

I was going to fall off, over the side, and there was nothing beneath me.

I cast around for something heavier to jump to, but nothing looked large enough to support my weight. I imagined tumbling into space gripping an end table, maybe a dozen pounds lighter as it tried to fall back up to its cylindrical floor. Which would be no consolation at all as I plunged into nothingness.

There was no time. I scrambled onto the pedestal of the headboard, itself beginning to slope as the bed slid around to the lower half of the curve. {i/No time.} I leapt for a bulky chest of drawers six feet away, arms grasping for handles, edges.

I smashed into it and hugged its sides. But I was too heavy. I pulled away from the cylinder, dragging the piece of furniture with me off the curving wall of its ground, and we both began to fall.

I screamed in frustration and let it go, grabbing instead for the loose rope coiling by my head. The chest of drawers {i/fell up}, sickeningly, and hit the cylinder above with a splintering crash. An instant later I wrenched to a jerking stop, the rope burning through my fingers: I clenched with a death grip, tight enough to stop my fall{ch15 bookshelves addendum}.]

[MACRO ch15 bookshelves addendum][@ffbookshelves>, face battered by the landslide of books only now starting to peter out]
[MACRO maybedepositjoke][|{i/Someone's not getting their deposit back}, a surprisingly deep-seated part of my brain observed.]

[MACRO rope jerks to stop][~I jerked to a stop, the rope around my leg yanking me back with a stab of pain and flipping me upside down. I swung in sickening arcs, head twisting from side to side trying to understand what was happening, but for a moment nothing made sense, my headlamp strobing through images I couldn't assemble into a coherent whole: a length of blue and white rope, a swinging body, a line of dusty floorboards. Frantic, I reached up and grabbed the rope, pulling myself more or less upright, swaying dizzyingly{ch15 bookshelves addendum}]

I took a breath but it didn't help.

[@ffset>I dangled thirty or forty feet below the underside of the bedroom platform, swinging on my rope. A ways below and twenty feet away, Elder Niko swung from his end of the rope, off the other side of the platform. Above us on its top, out of sight now, our ropes met at the anchor of furniture I'd wrapped them around; the awful juddering had stopped, so our roughly equal weights were balancing the pulls on it from opposite directions. We swung in sickening arcs over the void. But we'd stopped. We weren't falling.

|@fftubeweird>I dangled twenty feet below the bed I was tied to, now dragged around to the bottom of the cylinder, gripping my rope at a point halfway up its length. Another twenty feet of slack curled beneath me. Below that was Elder Niko, swinging from the other end of the same rope, which in between us still looped around the lashed-together furniture above. He had come to a much rougher stop than me and was gasping, momentum swinging him in sickening arcs over the void beneath us.

|@fftube>I dangled thirty feet below the cylinder, two ends of the same rope rising to curve up its top side towards the anchor of bed they were wrapped around, now out of sight. Beneath me, Elder Niko swung from his end of the rope. His side happened to have been longer and he'd therefore come to a rougher stop than me; he was gasping, momentum swinging him in sickening arcs over the void beneath us.
]

I looked up for younger Niko, and immediately regretted it. 

[@fftube>He'd stopped his fall by grabbing hold of my rope, but he wasn't tied to it, and was far enough above me that the bottom side of the cylinder was within reach, upside-down furniture bolted to its surface. And before I could open my mouth to scream {i/No!} he leapt for it.

He arced across empty space, {niko grabs bookcase sequence}

|@ffset>A network of dark guy-wires splayed out from the bottom corners of the bedroom set, like the ones from its wirework top, angling in straight lines down and away {guywiredest}, and through luck young Niko's downward path had intersected a cluster of them. He was just clinging to one, struggling to snag his foot on another, but the wires bounced angrily with absorbed momentum, and were caked with grease and dust. His fingers were slipping free. In seconds, he'd fall. 

He looked down at me, frantic, dangling from my rope.

|@fftubeweird>A free-standing doorframe stuck out of the cylinder, about two thirds of the way around the curve to the bottom. He must have grabbed the doorknob as he fell and twisted it, swinging the door open. Now he dangled from the knob of the open door, sideways and slanting down, and as I watched, a bracket holding it to the doorjamb groaned and twisted loose, only two bent screws still holding it in.

His hand was slipping on the knob. He looked down at me, frantic; looked over at the bed-and-armoire anchor his double and I were dangling from.]

I opened my mouth to scream {i/No!} and he leapt for it.

Because the only reason Elder and I {anchor weight sequence}]

[MACRO anchor weight sequence][@ffset>had stopped was that we balanced either other out. But with two bodies on one side of the rope, there was no way our anchor up top would stay put. No way in hell.

He collided with my rope maybe fifteen feet above me, wrapping grease-smeared hands around it tight. Above us, the platform groaned and vibrated as the bed started skidding across its surface, pulled back towards our side again. We began to drop, like eggs in a basket being lowered from a window. Beneath and across from us, Elder Niko started to rise.|@fftubeweird>weren't pulling our anchor down was that it outweighed us. The pull of the cylinder's strange gravity overruled our downward tug, which was lighter.

But there was no way all three of us were lighter than that anchor. No way in hell.

He smashed into the armoire, shoving it sideways, and flailed for it. The bed jolted with it, its legs scraping across the cylinder above us with his momentum, but it didn't stop. I watched in horror as the bed slid off the curve above us into empty space, then began to arc down, toward us, away from the floor above it.

We were starting to fall.]

# Don't show this bit for ffset because we just described Ryan as having split-second reflexes!
[@fftubeweird>If it had been me, we'd all have died. I need time to consider a situation, to think things through. I don't have split second reflexes.

Niko does.

|@ffset>Niko moved.

[@fftube>|{niko saves himself sequence}]

[MACRO niko saves himself sequence][@ffset>Like lightning he shot up the rope, climbing hand over hand like a demon. With everything in motion it was hard to tell at first if he was gaining on the platform above us, the bottom of the set, but then I could see he was, was almost to it. A muffled crunching smash came from the top of the platform as our anchor smashed into some other piece of furniture, and our descent slowed: but only for seconds. Niko used every one of them. Just as the anchor had begun to pick up speed again and my stomach had started to drop, Niko pushed off the taut rope and grabbed desperately for a dark mass of pipes and ductwork extending from the bottom of the set.

His hand closed around a metal pipe and he gripped it tight, swaying, then pulled himself up to a perch in the exposed network of house guts. My descent had stopped as once again the force on the two ropes became equal.|He shot a glance behind him and kicked off the anchor, {niko grabs bookcase sequence}

His weight now off it, the bed arced back up, pulling us with it.

But it hit the floor above our heads with disturbingly gentle force. We even bounced a foot or two back down before coming up to rest. My skin crawled as I realized what this meant: even without the weight of an extra Niko, we came horrifyingly close to outweighing our anchor.]

[MACRO niko grabs bookcase sequence][~smashing into {nikoSmashTarget} that I'm pretty sure was an IKEA Billy. He grabbed for a shelf but it pulled free, designed to resist only force pulling it down; books flew everywhere, but Niko's grip flashed to the solid side of the bookshelf and he jerked to a halt, {bookcase halt details}]

[@ffset>But the anchor of furniture groaned above us, shifting uneasily, and as I looked back to Elder Niko I realized I was in trouble. Though he'd started well below me, we now swayed an almost equal distance beneath the set, and he was swinging on the end of his rope, deliberate, getting closer each time. Eyes locked on me. {pp} Reaching out his hand for my rope.|@fftubeweird>The bed groaned, creaking, and one corner lifted again off the cylinder's surface. {elder climbs rope bit}|@fftube>The rope creaked uneasily. {elder climbs rope bit}]
[MACRO elder climbs rope bit][~I looked down. Elder Niko was climbing his rope, hand over hand. Murder in his eyes.]

I leapt up mine, for a second sure I'd be faster. I had a head start. I was twenty years younger.

But my life hadn't been given over to surviving down here, to stalking, to killing. [@fftubeweird>And I'd forgotten I wasn't at the end of my rope. Slack|And my slack] coiled beneath me[@fftubeweird>. It gave me a head start, but also|:] a leash, tied to my ankle.

[@ffset>In another swing Elder reached the loop and grabbed it. Then he hung|Elder reached the loop and hung] his full weight on it.

I slipped four feet before my grip on the rope was firm enough to stop me, friction-burned hands screaming.

Below me, he laughed, and sprang up [@ffset>my side of] the rope like it was a ladder. My arm muscles were already aching. Before I could pull myself up more than a foot or two, his hand closed around my ankle.

I strained to pull away, kicking[@fftube>|, and again felt the bed shift unsteadily above]. I looked up. Younger Niko's gaze met mine; he clung to [@ffset>a rook's nest of plumbing,|the slanting bookcase, skiwampus,] casting around for a way to help, but there was nothing in reach. He couldn't help me.

I looked down and saw the same face, shriveled in a blink by decades of rage into something monstrous. 

“We don't have to do this,” I panted, still trying to shake my leg free from his cold grasp. “We can all go through, get to the surface. Then go our separate ways. Like you said.”

“You fucking idiot.” With the hand not gripping me he fumbled at his belt. “You thought after all this time down here I'd {i/forgive} you? That we could be friends again like old times? No. You're going to die. And then I'll hunt that bitch down”---his eyes flashed up to his younger clone---“and kill him, again. First things first, though.” And he reached up with the knife he'd unclipped from his belt, flipped it open, and sawed into my calf.

I screamed, trying to pull away, but his other hand gripped my leg tight, and I looked up through the pain and starred vision at my Niko's shocked, helpless, too-distant face, and below me his double laughed and kept sawing with terrible strength. In one fierce thrust he sawed through my jeans and into my skin, and drew the serrated blade back, cutting deeper, into flesh, into muscle.

# If originalNiko is set and the first option is picked, this makes the revelation more obvious. But it's interesting to have that be in the possibility space.
“It's your fault,” he grunted, and the strength drained from my hands as hot pain sliced through me.
[“I went looking for you. You know that? How I got lost.” {sawing1} “We had a fight. Don't remember. What about.” {sawing2} “But I remember hating you. I remember that. I remember hating you and deciding to go back anyway. If I hadn't, if I'd turned around, I would have felt the sun again.” {sawing3} “But I went back. For you.”|“All of this. Why it happened. You led me here. You led us both.” {sawing1} “This place. Only exists because of you.” {sawing2} “You can't see that, I know, but it's clear. To me.” {sawing3} “Clear as the waters. The dream. This stream.”|“Everything. All of it. Your lies. Your schemes.” {sawing1} “A chain of bullshit. Unbroken.” {sawing2} “Bet you never thought it'd end like this, though, did you?”]
He sawed the blade deeper and I screamed and realized, then, that I couldn't escape this, couldn't escape him, that if I didn’t die from falling or bleeding out or being left for dead the best I could hope for would be a life down here in the dark, like him, left to wander forever, trapped, helpless, lost. Fighting it was impossible. It was already done and settled, and had been from the moment we'd first set foot Downstairs, from the moment we saw the house, from the moment we'd first met.
[MACRO sawing1][~My blood dribbled onto his face and he spat it away.]
[MACRO sawing2][~He pulled the blade back and I screamed, trying to twist away, but he only gripped me more firmly.]
[MACRO sawing3][~His breath was ragged. He shifted his grip on the knife.]

“He won't forgive you, either.” He grimaced up at his younger self through teeth stained red by my blood. “He just hasn't realized it yet.”

“He's not you,” I gasped, “he'll never be you.” And because I couldn't make myself believe it I stomped down on his face as hard as I could.

# Elder falls and sways back and forth.
He let out a {i/whoof} of air and something crunched as a splatter of blood arced out into darkness. His eyes rolled up into his head and he went limp, and then he fell. In thirty feet he reached the end of the rope around his waist and it [@ffset>jerked him away in a huge arc, flailing his limbs like a scarecrow. He swung in sickening curves beneath me, spread-eagled, face up, over the void. Eyes closed.|jerked him to a horrible stop, flailing his limbs like a scarecrow. He dangled there, spread-eagled, face up, over the void. Unmoving.]

Somewhere above me Niko was whooping in victory, but I barely heard him through the blood thumping in my ears, the high-pitched scream of pain in my leg. Refocusing my eyes, I dragged them down. The knife was still embedded in my calf. As if from a great distance, I reached with one hand, gripping the rope tight with the other, and pulled it free in a queasy sucking motion. Blood dribbled down my pant leg, dripping off my foot. Numbness and pain rippled through me, and muscles spasmed in my arm, but there was something I had to do before any other concerns. Woozy, I [@ffset>slid the knife under my belt, and started to climb back up. From the top of the platform I could cut myself free, let Elder's weight pull him and his anchor down. All the way down to hell.|pressed the knife to the second rope, and started to saw.]

# Instead of cutting the rope, intends to climb to the top and unclip, let Elder pull the furniture and him down. Young Niko climbs up and secures the top anchor.
“No, wait!” Niko shouted down at me. “The key! Do you have the key?”

I looked up, [@ffset>not really registering the words he'd said|blade held against the rope]. “What?”

“To get back to [@originalniko>our|your] side.” His voice seemed distant, swallowed up by [@ffdropoff>empty space|the canyon of insulation]. Maybe I was losing more blood than I realized. “[@originalniko>|Our side, I mean. The right side. ]The doorway's close. It has to be. But you need to get the key.”

{i/Front pocket, right side.}

Below me, Elder Niko still [@ffset>swung|swayed] at the end of his rope, eyes closed. [@ffset>|Motionless.] I didn't think I could have killed him, but I must have knocked him out.

{i/Or he wants you to think you did, anyway.}

[@ffset>Niko was clambering one handhold and foothold at a time to the edge of the floating set. He reached it and clambered up onto its surface with a sigh of relief. Peering over the edge on hands and knees, he shouted down to me. “Look, I'll pile some more furniture on the bed, weigh the anchor down. Enough weight for you to climb down his rope.” 

I hung indecisive for a long moment. Then, with a sigh like a death rattle, I began to swing. Building up momentum.

Reaching for the other rope.
|I still held the knife against the rope. Loose white innards strained free from the cut I'd started, escaping the tension of the deadweight below. 

But the cut was still shallow, tentative.

Uncommitted.

I nudged the knife closed, shoved it into my belt.]

“Hurry,” Niko hissed above me.

“Thanks,” I muttered. “Helpful.” 

[@ffset>Muffled sounds of shifting furniture floated down as I swung. Otherwise the silence was oppressive,|I started down.

I climbed fast, muscles trembling. The silence unsettled,] now that no one was talking or scrambling or trying to kill anyone. It felt like the surrounding darkness was a blanket, muffling, infinitely thick. A dangerous unreality was taking hold, like this was a video game. A dream. I shook my head, fighting mental fog. Tried to feel the pain in my leg, to let it be an anchor to keep me from floating away.

[@ffset>Eventually I'd swung far enough to grab Niko's rope. At first I could simply climb down it, my own rope tracing a rising angle back up to the opposite side of the platform. But as it grew taut I realized I had a problem.|I got to the end of my rope and realized I had a problem.] When I'd looped it around the bed I hadn't bothered to even out the two sides. And now, at the end of mine, I was still a few body lengths above Niko. I couldn't reach him. His side had happened to be the longer one, and the only way down to him now would be climbing the last few feet on the other end of the rope. His end.

Which meant detaching myself from mine.

With one hand I scrabbled pitifully at the knot, but untying it was hopeless for half-a-dozen reasons, my weight on it not the least. There was only one way to get off my rope onto his.

Below me, Elder Niko let out a gormless groan, head lolling to one side. But his eyes stayed closed.

A strange clarity had descended on me, the disconnected panic that comes from piling bad decisions on bad decisions, realizing you've gone too far but no longer able to stop. [@ffset>|Shifting my grip to Niko's rope,] I flipped open the knife again, and before indecision could paralyze me, I cut through my own rope, just above the knot at my ankle.

It was done. [@ffset>My rope swung away out of the range of my headlamp, swallowed up by darkness. His|His rope] creaked as it took my weight. I tried not to hear it. Tucking the knife into my belt, I lowered myself the last few feet to Elder Niko's body.

He was still splayed out, spread-eagled, face up, eyes closed. Blood and spittle drooled from the corner of his mouth.

His fingers twitched in gentle spasms, the last motions of a dying insect.

We were surrounded by darkness. [@ffdropoff>{maybe light below addendum}]
[MACRO maybe light below addendum][@TheCity>The faint streetlights miles below, the pools of desk lights and floor lamps above, bookended but did not penetrate the dark we swam together in.]

Gripping the rope with one numbing fist, I reached out with my other hand, fingers brushing the edge of his pocket. He groaned again, flopped his head sideways.

I pushed my fingers inside, feeling for the key.

There.

I pulled it free, carefully, gripping tight as the tines tugged the lining of his pocket, caught on its edge. I focused all my attention on not dropping it, not letting it tumble down into oblivion; on pulling my hand slowly, deliberately, out of his pocket.

Which is why I didn't notice his eyes had opened. Not until his hand closed around my wrist. 

“The fuck,” he muttered, lids heavy, speech slurred, “you doing down there?”

His grip on me was weak, but I felt the gathering awareness in him, like a coiling viper. His face was smeared with blood, and more had rushed to his head as he dangled, making his face look misshapen, swollen. One of his pupils had dilated all the way open, and a blood vessel in the eye had burst, a spidery red blotch reaching tendrils through the white. He looked monstrous.

[@originalniko>“I let you swim through first,” {elder1}. “Can't remember. Why. Guess I thought I still owed you. A debt.” {elder2}. “Stupid. Wrong. Couldn't find my way. Back up. Think about that mistake every day, every day, every day...”|{elder ramblings}]
[MACRO elder ramblings][“I came back for you,” {elder1}. “That's how... I got lost. Wanted to save you from... some old man.” {elder2}. “Can't remember. Who he was. Doesn't matter. Never mattered.”|“It's all because of you,“ {elder1}. “You're where all the possibilities spring from. You started something, somehow.” {elder2}. “The flow. The troubles. This dream. This. Stream. Irrational.” He swallowed, made the ghost of a laugh. “Three eight, three, eight three, eight three eight...”|“Never the same with you,” {elder1}. “When you weren't scared things were. Better.” {elder2}. “My Ryan. Used to do whatever. Whatever I wanted. He was. He was made for me.”|“I hated you,” {elder1}. “And I came back for you. I hated you and I came back.

[MACRO elder1][~he muttered, eyelids fluttering closed]
[MACRO elder2][~He blinked, coughed]

I let him rant. [^Delusional.|Maybe he didn't know what he was saying.]

But I saw him then with a sudden chill clarity. I understood he was only monstrous because of what I'd done to him. And I'd only done it because of what he'd done to me.

[@vortex>We were our own vortex, circling, wanting to converge but never meeting in the middle. Dragging each other down, deeper and deeper and deeper.|@gardens>We were our own feedback loop, like those gardens grown wild and tangled in places they never should have thrived, species not meant to root together kept alive through some misguided hope, some impossible force.|@caves>We were two boys lost in a cave, daring each other deeper, hearing voices but too afraid to really listen, digging doomed rescue tunnels we pretended were for each other, not ourselves.

# couldn't quite make this one work: |@snakeoil>We were two suckers looking to each for an impossible cure-all, an elixir that would make us whole and healed. Conning each other again and again, a bottomless spring of hope that our problems could be fixed by somebody else.

“I'm sorry,” I said, gently pulling free of his grip and slipping the key into my pocket. He scrabbled at my waist with his other hand, pathetic, as if trying to get a grip on my belt to pull himself up. “Sorry for dragging you down here. You deserved... someone better than me to be your friend. And you can hurt me, hunt me, kill me as many times as you want but it'll never change that. Never take it back.” I took a deep breath. “But I can't let you do it any more. You don't deserve to die, but...” My eyes flicked up, then back to his. “Neither does he.”

He smiled, blood spilling from the corner of his mouth, and as it dribbled away something changed. Like the light had shifted, popped a shadow into a shape. [@gorilla>Like noticing the gorilla in the crowd.|Like pixels in a game turning from smudge to solution.]

The confusion in his eyes had been a lie. They were perfectly clear. 

“Too bad,” he said, “no one gets what they deserve.”

He had the knife in his hand. My belt. He'd slipped it off my belt while I was babbling.

I swung sideways as he lunged it at my face, and it nicked my ear. There was no grogginess in him, no disorientation. I'd just seen what I'd wanted to see, one last time. I'd never really seen him at all.

My muscles tensed to fling myself back up the rope, but without the knife I'd never make it. Never be free of him. Certainty flushed through me. This had to end. This had to be the last time.

He lunged again and I grabbed his wrist, wrenching it backwards, trying to pull the knife free. He snarled and reached for me with his other hand but I twisted away. We swayed and twirled at the end of the rope, the rope I was no longer tied to, clinging instead with one desperate, trembling hand. I felt fibers snapping [@ffset>somewhere above us; this rope wasn't rated to hold two people|as the cut I'd started above us frayed, grew larger]. One way or another this was about to end.

He stabbed at my face again and I swung to the side, just enough for his hand to brush past me, so I bit down on it as hard as I could. He swore as I ground down harder, feeling flesh give, tasting blood. Sensing his grip loosen, I snatched the knife, his expression of shock burned into my vision even as I turned away, already climbing. Maybe I'd never done that before, in all the times he'd attacked me. Maybe I'd never fought back.

I climbed, the knife clenched between my teeth. For a fleeting moment, and maybe for the first time in my life, I felt like a badass.

But I'd bought myself only seconds and not enough. I'd pushed well past the limit of my endurance. I barely had the strength to pull myself up. I'd put a few body lengths between us, but he could swallow that lead in seconds. I was a wounded rabbit limping from a wolf.

Below me something screamed and I realized it was him; a terrible scream, rage and pain and loneliness and betrayal etched onto air. He started up the rope after me.

“Get. Back. Here.” He growled. “Get the fuck. Back down here. I'm not finished. With you.”

Bloodstained rage twisted his face. He was gaining. He was going to [end|kill] me.

And then a dictionary clobbered him in the face.

I looked up, shocked, at a triumphant Niko [@ffset>peering over the edge of the platform,] shaking a fist down at us. “Leave him the fuck alone, dickweed!”

[@ffset>He'd piled books scavenged from the bedroom set next to him on the edge. He had|He'd clambered up on the tilted side of the bookshelf,] another heavy hardback already in his hand. He hefted it, gaged the distance, and flung.

[@fftubeweird>It curved as the cylinder's gravity tugged it around, hyperbolic, and went wide, whipping underneath us and then back up toward the floor. Any harder and he'd have launched it into a miniature orbit.|The angle was awkward for throwing, and this time the missile went wide, plummeting down into darkness with its pages aflutter, like they wanted to take wing.] But he'd already grabbed another book.

Below me, his elder was shaking off the blow.

I climbed.

Niko kept throwing books, and some collided with my pursuer, enough to throw him off balance, to buy me more seconds. I needed every one. I was fading fast, and so was the rope. Muscles tore and fibers snapped. My vision shrunk to a wavering tunnel, only my hands and the rope visible in the deepening blackness. 
#I climbed, and when I reached the cut end of my own rope I pulled it up after me, keeping it out of his grip.
# ^^^ This technically covers a minor plot hole, but it's confusing and most people are not going to notice...
I climbed.
I climbed with some reserve of strength I'd never guessed I had.

[@ffset>After a particularly vicious clobbering I gained a body length and stopped climbing,|I reached the notch in the rope and climbed a few feet past it,] spit the knife into my hand, and [began|started] to saw.

“Faster,” someone was muttering, maybe me, “faster.”

The Niko below flung himself up the rope. [@ffset>I hadn't gained enough distance, after all.] He'd almost reached me. 

A crushing inevitability pressed into me, from tingling arms to kicking feet. Someone had already won. Someone would live. The clock would run out and we'd find out who.

{i/Faster.}

Fibers twisted, stretched, broke free.

A copy of {FavBook} arced smoothly by my head.

Guttural noises just beneath me. It was too late. He was here.

And then the rope split.

He was at my feet. He flung himself at them when he heard the tear of the rope giving way, but had nothing to push off, no momentum to save him. He scrambled frantic as the rope went weightless in his hands, a finger brushing my shoe[@fftubeweird>, and for an instant it was as if the cylinder above was toying with him, uncertain whether to hold him with its gravity. Whether he had become enough a part of this place that its attraction should compel him, too].

Then he fell.

Within a second he'd plunged past the range of our lights, swallowed by blackness. Only then, after losing sight of him, did he scream, and there was no fear in it at all. Just rage.

But it was a tiny sound, [@ffdropoff>lost in vanishing darkness|eaten up by miles of pink insulation], fading fast and not repeated.

He was gone.
