When I was little, my dad used to come tuck me in at night, and sometimes I'd blink and he'd disappear. He'd be sitting on my bed, singing or smoothing my sheets or telling a story, warm and alive, and between one blink and the next he'd be gone. My heart would thump and I'd clutch the blanket, terrified, eyes thrashing back and forth across the dark spaces of my room like a trapped bird looking for a way out, looking for him, but he'd be gone, and I'd be alone.\n\nMaybe premonition. More likely was that I'd fall asleep, waiting for him to come in, and dream he had. Some noise would jerk me up to a room where he'd long since looked in on me and pulled the door gently shut. But how I rationalize it makes no difference. It doesn't change how I lived that loss, each night it happened. How I can feel it even today. The person who loved me most, erased from existence in a blink. I'll never forget how that felt.

Useful, sometimes, but usually, usually...\n\nBut it taught me an important lesson. Just because something isn't real doesn't mean it can't hurt you. I'll never forget some of the things I {i/possibled}, even if they never really happened. There's truth in first impressions, in fleeting visions, even if it's not the kind we're trained to trust. Stories make shapes, build structure out of shadows: calcified shells that linger long after muddled innards fade. They're not the real thing, as gloriously as they pretend to be. But still. Sometimes they're enough.\n\n|\n\nI used to have these dreams, when I was young. Did I ever tell you this? I'd be wandering an endless beach of smooth white sand, unbroken but for a handful of deep and conical pits. I'd peer into these when I neared one, anxious, feet clenching the loose sand of its lip. Sometimes there'd be a puddle of murky water at the bottom. Sometimes a dark opening. Sometimes teeth. Even the ones without teeth ached with some invisible wrongness, were more than negative spaces in sand. They had energy, a primal liveness. They were hungry. I was fascinated and repelled by them, drawn to their edges again and again, toes curling, though I'd try to stay away. But they multiplied as I wandered, puncturing the flat sand more and more until they reduced it to a maze of pathways, then one of ridges. Inevitably I'd take a wrong step and start to slide, tumbling with the treacherous sand down toward the dark of the bottom, a point just large enough to slip through, to swallow me up. Almost always I'd wake before I reached it, but once I slid past pit-teeth and they bit me, sliced into my back, and I woke with a shock of pain so intense I screamed. I'd tumbled out of my bunk bed and fallen onto a half-assembled model; plastic struts had pierced my skin. I got rushed to the hospital in the middle of the night, mom in her dressing gown and me in bloody pajamas, and got ten stitches. I'd woken up too late. The pit had won. \n\nMaybe premonition, the dreams, but I think something simpler. Even that young I'd found the fears I'd struggle with well into adulthood. Losing control. Facing the unknown. And knowing that just because something isn't real doesn't mean it can't hurt you. At four years old I told myself a story of teeth and sand traps. It would take the rest of my life to understand why.\n]\n\n[So. Maybe a story is|So maybe story is|But this story. Our story. Maybe it's] a language we can speak[^, you and I].

There wasn’t exactly a roadmap for what happened[ to us], a script to follow. But it’s undeniable that even on that very first night[---the night of the Russian dance club, remember?---|, the night of the Russian dance club, ]everything was already wrong.\n\n\n\n\n[MACRO We'd moved in a few weeks back][~We’d moved in a few weeks back, Niko and I and our friends, mostly his, students and lapsed students and a few brave graduates, still settling into the rambling old off-campus house we’d found in the newspaper. (Cast your mind back to a time when kids like us had figured out the internet but people old enough to own property hadn’t, so instead of browsing classifieds our bandwidth went entirely to downloading all the music in the world.)]\n\n[DEFINE @clubintro|@makeupintro|@noodlesintro]\n\n[*Ch1IntroScene*@clubintro>I hadn't wanted to go to the club. But Niko insisted. “Russian techno, man, one night only. That new place over by the old stadium. Lots of sexy people will be there, including us.” I ran out the usual litany of excuses: I had work in the morning, I had Bio homework to do, I hated going out to clubs with a burning passion. He batted them all away without any obvious effort, and so that's how I found myself pressed up against a wall listening to music so loud it hurt, arms crossed, feeling miserable, wishing I was back home listening to a Dvořák symphony instead.\n\nWhen I could see him through the crowd, I watched Niko surf it, laughing, gesticulating wildly as he somehow held conversations despite the deafening racket, and dancing his ass off, {niko dance details} I’d worn my rainbow pride bracelet at his insistence, the one I’d bought a few months back and mostly been too chickenshit to wear (it was a college town but a conservative state). I might as well have worn a bag over my head, despite Niko's assurances that The Gays were almost definitely very into Russian techno, he was pretty sure. “Or maybe all those pulsing Slavic rhythms will make some drunk straight guy want to get all experimental and shit,” he said, waggling his eyebrows. “Never know.”\n\nI knew. And I was right: nothing happened. No one talked to me, or even noticed me, and standing there, I couldn't imagine why they would, why anyone would want to talk to an acne-faced geek in clothes that didn't fit, leaning against a grimy wall and wishing he were anywhere else.\n\nFrom across the club, Niko caught my eye, and gradually danced his way up to me, strobe lights washing out his tawny skin, twisting through his dark curls. He arrived within the eighteen-inch earshot zone and shouted something.\n\n“What?”\n\nHe put his lips up to my ear, shouted again. “Having fun, Ryan?” He pulled back with a cheeky grin, and cackled in delight when he saw my expression, grabbing my arm. “Come on, man,” he yelled, “let's get some air.”\n\nDragging me through the crush of people, still dancing, bopping his head to the music, waving at some people and smirking seductively at others, he somehow managed to maneuver us through an impossible blockade of bodies without stepping on any toes or getting stepped on in return, toward a back exit I hadn't even realized existed, all while making eye contact every few steps to make sure I was okay. I'd never figured out how he managed to do so many things at once. Sometimes even one thing at a time was too much for me.\n\nWe pushed through a metal door into a blessed pillow of colder, quieter air, where a handful of smokers stood around chatting. I took a deep breath, more relieved than I'd expected to be. Niko pulled a single cigarette from behind his ear---he'd quit; someone inside must have given it to him---and bummed a light from one of the smokers. We walked a few paces farther out into the parking lot, enjoying the night air.\n\n“So what's wrong?” he finally asked.\n\nI sighed. “This isn't really my scene.”\n\n“Leaving the house isn't really your scene, yeah, I get it.” He blew smoke from the side of his mouth, raising one wry eyebrow. “But you have to take chances, man. Get out of your comfort zone. I mean what was the point of coming out if you never actually {i/go out}?”\n\n“Well it's fucking easier for you,” I said, feeling miserable. “You can sit next to some girl in class, bump into her on the street. Say sorry for spilling her coffee, waggle your eyebrows, and boom, long term relationship.”\n\n“Yeah, that's definitely how that works,” he said. “So if it's that easy, Ry, how come I've been single for the last forever?”\n\n“Your terrible fashion sense, probably,” I said, looking down at my sneakers, although truth be told it was a mystery to me too. It had been almost a year since his last relationship. Still more recent than mine. “Okay, lame excuse. I'm just... bad at meeting people. And I don't get how you're supposed to do it when the music's so loud you can't even think.”\n\nHe shrugged. “Serendipity is everywhere. So give it an excuse to happen to you. Get out there, take chances. I mean there's gay people everywhere, dude, even in this shithole state. You just have to man it up and figure out who they are.”\n\nI looked up at him, startled, but he was looking away towards the horizon, expression distant, thinking about something. I looked back down at the ground before he could see me looking. {i/Stupid.}\n\n“Should I take you home?” he asked at last.\n\n“You don't need to babysit me.” My mood was blackening. “I can look after myself.”\n\n“So do. No point making yourself miserable if you're not having fun.”\n\n“I thought...” I didn't know how to finish. I thought he'd wanted me to come. I thought if he were here, maybe I'd enjoy it. I thought I could pretend to be a person who enjoyed clubs, crowds, Russian techno. I'd thought, despite all evidence, that tonight would be different. \n\n“You're right. Guess I should jet.” Hoping my voice wouldn't betray what was welling up inside me, I looked up, met his eyes with the best fake smile I could muster. “Catch you later, man.”\n\nHe looked straight back at me and I could tell he wasn't buying any of it.\n\nFlicking the cigarette onto the asphalt, he ground it out with his heel, clapped my shoulder. “I'll come with you.”\n\n“No, you don't have to,” I said, flooded by an awkward admixture of guilt and relief. “I'm fine. You go back in there and have some fun. Find some hot pixie chick with feathers weaved into her hair and go wild.”\n\nHe shot me an annoyed look, brushing black curls back from his eyes. “Orion. I said I'm coming with you.” He put an arm around my shoulder and guided me into the parking lot. “The hot chicks in there obviously have terrible taste in music, if that's what you could call what they were playing. I expect you might have some opinions about that.”\n\n“{i/Well},” I said, emphatic, and laughed, surprised at myself. At him. He had a way of turning things around like that. Defeat into victory. No into yes. Everything was better again, at least for now.\n\nTalking, laughing, we struck out into the night for the long walk home.\n\n|@makeupintro>\n\nI was on the back porch, looking over the dying backyard grass at the sunset reddening the top of college hill. {We'd moved in a few weeks back} My Bio homework was in my lap but I couldn't remember what page the reading started on, or why I cared. All I could think about was whether the words I'd said that morning had cost me my best friend.\n\nSo when I heard him force his way into the house through the juddering side door, perpetually stuck, I stiffened. He'd stormed out after the argument and I hadn't heard from him since. I hadn't even started to work through my feelings about it, what I'd said and what I hadn't. I didn't know what to say to him now. Which one of us needed to apologize, or for what.\n\nI tensed, waiting to hear if he'd head upstairs to his room or find me out here, not sure which I wanted. The possibility seemed suspended, unresolved, for an uncomfortably long time.\n\nThe screen door creaked and Niko stepped out onto the porch. I didn't turn around. He walked over and stood at the railing next to me, an unlit cigarette between his lips, facing the twilight. \n\nHe sucked on the cigarette for a long minute ineffectually, distracted, then slipped it back into his pocket. Gripped the railing.\n\n“Hey,” he finally said, “wanted to invite you out. With a bunch of us,” he added, a bit too smooth. “There's this new dance club over by the old stadium. Supposedly they play this fucking feral, crotch-pummeling Russian dance music and lots of sexy people will be there tonight, including us.”\n\n“Huh.” I blinked, not quite getting what this was. “Not really my thing.”\n\n“I mean in a weird way it kind of might be? I mean you like Shostakovitch, right? He's Russian. And isn't techno sort of the people's music of the modern day? Simple, rhythmic, obnoxiously loud?”\n\nHe was reaching. It was kind of sweet but I still felt sullen. “Is this you apologizing?”\n\nHe let out a breath, deflating. “I don't know what you want from me, man. After everything we've been through together, you think we'd be past this kind of shit.”\n\nI couldn't think of what to say. I realized I was being unfair but I also felt terrible unresolved wounds between us. The things I'd said that morning hadn't stopped being true. {i/You're smothering me. I can't always be there for you. Sometimes you're too much.}\n\n{i/Sometimes, I feel like I can't escape you.} I hadn't said that last one.\n\nBut. I also hated to feel estranged from him. I wanted everything back the way it was before. More than anything.\n\nWe let the twilight happen to us for another couple minutes.\n\n“It is me apologizing,” he said at last. “You're my best friend, Ryan. I can't stand to have you angry at me. I need you to---” He stopped, face reddening, scuffed his feet on the deck. “I mean I'd like to have you around.” He pulled the cigarette out again, had it to his lips before realizing the lighter he'd thrown out a week ago still wasn't in his pocket. He sighed and dropped it onto the lawn.\n\n“So come out to the club,” he said. “We can hate Russian techno together. I'll buy the drinks. Let's go have a good time. Yeah?”\n\n“I've got Bio homework.” I looked down at the still-closed textbook in my lap, face reddening. “And I don't want to be around a lot of loud drunk people tonight. Or loud drunk music.”\n\n“It won't be any fun if you aren't there,” he said quietly.\n\nI looked up and met his glance, expecting the vulnerability I'd only seen there a handful of times, but found something else. The half-grin and cocked eyebrow that said he wasn't taking no for an answer, and maybe it said something else, or I wanted to pretend it did. His eyes were so fucking sharp. When they looked at you and wanted something, it hurt.\n\nI sighed. “I'm going to hate it.”\n\n“Yeah you are.” He grinned wickedly. “Every second. We're leaving at eight. I'll knock on your door.” He clapped me on the shoulder. “Who knows. Maybe some drunk straight guy will start making out with you cause Russian techno makes him feel all experimental and shit.”\n\n“That'll definitely happen.”\n\n“What was the point of coming out,” he said, already on his way back inside, “if you never actually {i/go out}?” He mimed dropping a mic and his head exploding, and {niko was gone and I was committed} \n\n|@noodlesintro>I was in the kitchen making ramen, that big kitchen with its vintage appliances and endless counter space, wasted on college kids. {We'd moved in a few weeks back}\n\nI was stirring noodles when Niko forced his way in through the side door, perpetually stuck, the soul-juddering screech of metal on wood already a familiar sound, a sound of home. We’d stopped using the front door for reasons I no longer remember, so everyone came and left through that massive kitchen. He was crooning some song I didn't know, and flashed his searing grin in my direction when he caught my eye, dancing his way over to me.\n\n“Ryan, my man,” he said, clapping me on the shoulder. “It is a goddamned beautiful day out there. What the deuce is up?”\n\n“Dinner,” I said, smiling despite myself. The temperature always rose a few degrees when he came into a room, like he radiated in all frequencies, emotional and thermal.\n\n“Ooh,” he said, wafting some steam from the pot up towards his nose like Food Network cameras were rolling. “Oriental flavor ramen. So international. Can I get in on that?”\n\n“Made two,” I said, tapping the empty plastic packages with the fork. I figured he'd be back from class and hungry, like on most nights. Feeding him was easier than explaining why he felt awful when he forgot to eat.\n\n“You're a rockstar.” He reached a bronzed hand into the pot to pinch up a couple noodles, winced at the heat and slurped them up. “Hey,” he added, mouth full, “what are you doing tonight?”\n\n“Oh, no.”\n\n“Hear me out.” He swallowed. “There's a bunch of people, like everyone, really, heading out to Orbits later. Heard of it?” I shook my head; he rolled his eyes. “Course you haven't. It's that new dance club over by the old stadium.”\n\n“Huh.” I stirred. “Not really my thing.”\n\n“Leaving the house isn't really your thing, yeah, I get it. But sometimes you have to get outside your comfort zone, you know?” He licked his fingers and fixed me with a look that said he wasn't taking no for an answer, and maybe it said something else, or I wanted to pretend it did. His eyes were so fucking sharp. When they looked at you and wanted something, it hurt.\n\n“Uh. I've got Bio homework.” I blinked. Green. His eyes were green. “And I don't want to be around a lot of loud drunk people tonight. Or loud drunk music.”\n\n“Oh {i/come on},” he pleaded, running a hand through his black curls. “It won't be any fun if you aren't there. Hey, maybe some drunk straight guy will start making out with you cause Russian techno makes him feel all experimental and shit.”\n\n“That'll definitely happen.”\n\n“Look man, what was the point of coming out if you never actually {i/go out}?” He crossed his arms. “Come on. Please?”\n\nIt clicked then that {i/he} was the one hoping to get some action tonight, probably with some sweet-smelling, dark-skinned exchange student with feathers weaved into her long, black hair. (Yes, {i/her}. I know, I know.) She was the one he wanted to take to this club. She was probably why he was in such an ecstatic mood. The thought of watching from a corner while he made moves on some intoxicating girl made my stomach knot up.\n\nBut there was something insistent in the way he demanded my presence. Why did he want me there, too? What role was I supposed to play?\n\nI sighed. “I'm going to hate it.”\n\n“Yeah you are.” He grinned wickedly. “Every second. We're leaving at eight.

[We were; we did|We did]. Especially since his accident, we’d had a profound if unspoken level of companionship I’d never felt with anyone. Usually I was content with that.\n\nIn some ways we had so little in common it was astonishing we'd become friends, and that led to frequent arguments, sometimes rising to breakup levels of drama. At other moments it seemed like the universe had meant us to find each other. Over the years we'd grown together, like two plants in the same small pot. It had been an especially tumultuous [four years of college|gauntlet of an undergrad]---although I guess it feels that way for everyone---so shared roots twined us together now, [half-remembered fragments of stories and selves|stuff we never talked about but didn't have to]: skipping a funeral to camp together in the rocky canyons of Brushwillow, sharing long silences amidst the lakes and pines; pulling all-nighters on mad projects with desperate stakes; driving to the next town over through a summer midnight, windows rolled down and air thrumming through, desperate to find fresh vegetables for reasons that seemed incredibly important at the time, buzzed from both caffeine and alcohol as in so many stories involving Niko. In our defense the alcohol was supposed to go in the ragu. \n\n[@clubintro>|I’d hated the club, as predicted. The music was so loud it hurt, almost as much as it hurt to call the shit they were blasting “music.” I’d worn my rainbow pride bracelet, the one I’d bought a few months ago and mostly been too chickenshit to wear (it was a college town but a conservative state). I might as well have worn a bag over my head. Everyone ignored me, including the hypothetical hot guys with loosened inhibitions. I stood against a wall hating myself and hating how I must have looked to everyone, an acne-faced geek in too-small clothes lurking on the outskirts, wishing he was back home listening to Dvořák symphonies. {maybech1alcbit} I watched Niko dance his ass off, {niko dance details} But he, too, seemed to fail at making any solid human connections{girl bit if noodles}and I was relieved when he cornered me and asked if I wanted to duck out early.]\n\n[MACRO girl bit if noodles][@noodlesintro>---the hypothetical supermodel exchange student either didn't exist or failed to appear---|, ]\n[MACRO maybech1alcbit][@alcohol>I drank too much, as usual, and as usual it didn’t help.]\n\nWalking back home from the club through the chill night air with him was a relief[@alcohol>, and not only because the shots were starting to hit me and walking a straight line on my own would have been rough]. The night felt endless, anonymous, an escape from daytime problems[@makeupintro>; the argument that morning already a long-forgotten memory, ancient history]. In the fall we'd be starting our fifth year of college, neither of us particularly close to graduating with any particular degree, and for the first time that felt ominous. The future staked out before us our whole lives was running out. A blank canvas ought to have been exciting, but any direction we could imagine to go in seemed blocked off, already closed, inaccessible or unrealistic. Friends were picking already between the remaining well-flagged routes: getting careers, getting married, getting pregnant, getting gone to new cities, new lives, new starts. It would be our turn soon enough.\n\nBy the time we hit the top of the hill and saw the house, we were ready to be back indoors. [@clubintro>{We'd moved in a few weeks back}] I'd gotten ranty about real music on the walk back, and as we stepped through the juddering screen door, its metal-on-wood screech already a familiar sound, I had a half-dozen songs queued up to play for him. [@clubintro>{pp}]Mentally, I mean: digital music players hadn't caught on yet back then, although it was still tragically too late for my records to be anything but anachronism. Vinyl wouldn't start making a comeback for years and was deader than dead. Maybe that was why I liked it. When we moved in I’d stacked my crates of LPs in the closet, so now as we tromped up the stairs to my room and dragged them out to hunt for the albums I wanted to play, we got [@alcohol>drunkenly] annoyed at the lack of anywhere to put them. So that was how I ended up on my hands and knees, searching for a way to open up my bed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Bed” was generous: it was a mattress, thrown on a raised wooden platform built into a corner of the room. [The platform was mattress-sized and had therefore|Mattress-sized, it had] seemed like the sensible spot to put one, but [the bulky thing also really seemed like it ought to be hollow and have|it also felt as if it should have had] some storage space inside. I’d never found any handles or hinges, but [@alcohol>in our drink-addled haze|with late-night logic] it seemed ridiculous that the thing couldn’t be opened somehow, and because I can’t leave well enough alone and because unsolved challenges annoy me, [@alcohol>and, okay, because booze,] there I was on hands and knees fiddling with the paneled edges of the platform, shoving and kneading and banging on them. When something finally gave with a satisfying {i/chunk}, I whooped in satisfaction; but leapt back startled when the whole platform groaned and swung up, pencils and organic chemistry textbooks sliding off the mattress onto the pitted hardwood floor.\n\nUnderneath was a set of steep stairs down.\n\n“Whoah,” Niko said, “Jackpot.”\n\nThey were carpeted in the same dark beige as the rest of the house, which looked like someone had redecorated in the seventies and died decades later unaware style had moved on. [Ten|Eleven|Twelve] steps led down to a landing where they twisted right and reversed. Cramped, but bland and familiar: the walls paneled in that same fake wood as the rest of the house, lit by those same tacky wall sconces. All as you'd expect from the stairs down to a basement, except we were on the second story and the house already had a basement, which emphatically did not connect through my bed.\n\nNiko laughed in astonishment. “What the fuck is this, man? What’s down there?”\n\n“Hell if I know. More secrets.” We were grinning, because this sort of thing had already happened a few times since we’d moved in. The house had been my find. The group of us were getting older (or so we thought then) and were [sick of living in shitty campus housing or the shittier apartments nearby preying on starving students|looking to move up in the world], so we pooled our resources to go in on a house in the pleasant tree-lined neighborhood a few blocks farther out. It was an old house, [maybe as much as a hundred years old,] but big, in good repair, and, most important, cheap: we were all paying less rent than when living in pairs or alone. I'd claimed the funky second-floor patio room in a lumpy wing extending into the backyard, clearly a later addition, and Niko snagged a creaking and stuffy room next to mine which he dubbed “lovingly misshapen.” A lot of the place was like that: a half-landing here, an awkward angle there, bits taken out and bricked over on some whim or other. The house had expanded and contracted over the generations, it seemed, in decades-long breaths. \n\n[DEFINE @dustyroom]\n[@dustyroom>The listing hadn't mentioned a secret passage. But it also hadn’t mentioned the closet with a door in the back leading to a dusty, forgotten room (which now housed a dusty, forgotten game of Axis and Allies); nor had it mentioned the extra bedroom in the basement tucked away around a corner and behind an unlikely-looking door. These small discoveries gave the place a quirky, rambling feel, and I loved it. My whole life I'd had dreams about finding new rooms in houses I'd lived in, each time with a thrill of discovery, of learning your cozy domain still had surprises, things left to find. Maybe it came from moving around all the time as a kid. Or maybe it said something about me. \n\nI still had them, the dreams. I didn't know they were about to get much worse.]\n\nNiko touched the angled bottom of the bed platform and looked at me, as if for permission. He gestured grandly downwards. “Well, Orion, should we check it out?”\n\nI gave him a formal bow, [@alcohol>the room only spinning a little|feeling puckish, giddy]. “Indeed, Nikolaos, let's fucking do it.”\n\nHe grinned and tousled my hair, bounding over the lip. He stooped as he took the first few steps, black curls brushing the underside of the tilted platform. \n\n“You going to fit down there?” I smirked. “This looks made for normal-sized people, not basketball players.”\n\n“High school power-forward Nick appreciates your validation of his identity, thanks,” he called back, almost to the landing. “College dilettante Niko, though, wants to know if you're fucking coming.”\n\nI hesitated on the threshold, strangely reluctant.\n\nHe turned from the landing to look back up, arms folded. “I'm not {i/that} tall, am I? I've only got like three inches on you and your---” He flailed a hand up and down at me. “Your demographically average carcass. Stop giving me complexes.”\n\n{i/Actually you're exactly four and a half inches taller than me. But who's counting.}\n\nHe shrugged, continued down the next set of stairs and out of sight. “Later, skater.”\n\nI flipped his skinny ass off and followed him down.\n\n[DEFINE @diary|@livejournal]\nDespite his complaints, Niko was in fact wearing a basketball jersey, but an ironic one from the thrift store, for some hopefully-fictional team called the Reagans. He wore a purple blazer over it, which I trust is all I need say about his fashion sense. Somehow, it worked. His horrifying ensembles always worked, whereas the clothes I’d buy, new or used, turned ugly, permanently wrinkled, and the wrong size by the time I got them home. “Dear [@diary>Diary,” I'd imagined writing in my nonexistent diary,|LiveJournal,” I'd written once in my private, locked LiveJournal account,] “I get now that I’m destined to die alone. You can stop sending me signs.” [@diary>You used to put self-deprecating shit like that in diaries, back before social media was invented. Not  bothering to keep the actual diary was about as unsatisfying as typing and erasing status messages without ever posting them; so if you do that a lot, I can relate.|I had never shared my LiveJournal account with anyone and never would, which some people had told me was missing the point. Nowadays on social media I do a lot of typing and erasing status messages without posting them. Maybe you can relate.]\n[MACRO diary][@diary>Diary|LiveJournal]\n\nAnyway. Niko had shrugged his shoes off when we’d gotten to my room, and now his bare feet sunk half an inch into carpet as he tromped down the stairs[, which was the detail I noticed]. His feet were hard not to notice: maybe it was all the basketball, or the Greek ancestry, but they were like statuary. Perfect.\n\nThe stairs were steep but otherwise unextraordinary. Around the corner, more of them dropped to a second landing. We stomped down, Niko's drunken excitement leading us on[ like a dog straining at a leash]. Past that corner was one more landing and one final run of steps[ that|. They] opened into a large, windowless room.\n\nIt was bigger than any other room in the house, maybe [thirty|twenty-five|thirty-five] feet across by [sixty or seventy|fifty or sixty|seventy-five or eighty] long. [(Logically it ought to have been the same size as the house's footprint, but both the dimensions and orientation were wrong for that.)] It had the same beige carpet and brown wall-paneling, tacky faux-bronze wall-sconces, and a plaster ceiling eight feet up. [Firewood was stacked up by two fireplaces on opposite walls, in the same style as the non-functional one upstairs hidden by our TV.] No windows, not even those awful basement ones that fill up with dead leaves and spider webs. [@furnished>A smattering of old couches and end tables lined the walls, along with|No furniture, either. Just] the expected bits of floor lint, carpet stains, wall gouges, and other subtle remnants of long occupation. A cool, musty smell suggested said occupation had been a long time ago.\n\nFive open doorways led out: two along each long edge, and one on the far wall opposite the stairs.\n\n“Holy shit, Ry, this is fucking amazing!” Niko's eyes lit up as he walked a few paces in[, tentative, like into a tide]. He flexed his bare toes on the ugly carpet. “It's like a whole secret underground lair!”\n\nI felt the same thrill, [mingled|mixed|tempered] with hesitation. Did our landlord somehow not know about all this extra space? Was it some kind of forgotten bomb shelter? Niko was already talking about throwing parties down here, [@furnished>cleaning up the|where to put] couches. A secret basement hangout spot.\n\n[DEFINE 20>@convopit]\nWe called it Downstairs, big D[, without really thinking about it]. [@convopit>The only noteworthy feature was a circular depression in the floor which confused Niko but which I recognized as a conversation pit.\n\n“This was a whole thing in the sixties,” I said. “See, you would sit in here, and you would talk.”\n\n“Huh.” He nudged the lip skeptically with his toe. “What's wrong with having a conversation, like, anywhere else?”\n\n“Well, you could, but then you wouldn't be having it {i/in the conversation pit}.”]\n\nThe architecture was making my head spin, though. [@alcohol>(Okay: also the beer.) But someone|Someone] else's bedroom was under mine. I felt an indignant vertigo, and made Niko come resolve this mystery before exploring any farther. We went back up to my room, then downstairs---regular lower-case downstairs---to reconnoiter. There was, in fact, an odd protrusion into the kitchen underneath and to one side of my room, and when we peeked into our absent housemate's bedroom around the corner, a mirroring blocky bulge in there. So together those two bulges explained the stairs, though not why you'd build a staircase in the middle of a wall like that. But the house was full of those weird angles and edges, so it seemed in character. \n\nWe went back Downstairs and [poked around|peeked into] a few of the side hallways. Pretty cramped, but no worse than other god-awful basement apartments I'd seen students living in. Like some of those, there were no windows anywhere, which made sense: it felt too far down. Rooms opened off the sides of the halls (those cheap particle-board doors, those rattling brass-plated tin doorknobs). Some were carpeted and looked like they could be bedrooms; others had bare concrete flooring like a laundry or utility room. [@furnished>Most had a piece or two of abandoned furniture, all decades out of date, dusty, and anonymous.|They were all empty.]\n\nThe hallways branched at the end: we picked one and saw both ways passed more doors before making L-turns, each in opposite directions. Those crappy wall sconces were everywhere, so despite the lack of windows, it was almost too bright. They were all lit, and weirdly enough we couldn't find a light switch anywhere.\n\n“[Are we|You don't think we're][^, uh,] paying for all this electricity?” Niko asked[ with jittery alarm|, alarmed].\n\n“We haven't gotten our first bill yet.” [@alcohol>I felt proud for not slurring my speech; witty.|I raised my eyebrows.] “Good thing we're splitting eight ways.”\n\nWe [didn't exhaustively explore, beyond checking|only explored a little farther, looking into] another hallway and seeing that it, too, branched and snaked off, shedding rooms left and right. Niko had started down that one, but I stopped, [@alcohol>a wave of nausea washing over me|hit by a wave of unexplained dizziness], and put a hand against the cold wall.\n\nHe stopped instantly. “You okay?”\n\n[@alcohol>I smiled, embarrassed. “I think, uh. Don’t want to get too far from a bathroom.”\n\nHe eyed me appraisingly. “You shouldn’t have done that last shot. I keep telling you. Beer before liquor, never sicker.”|“I don't know.” My head pulsed with another wave of nausea, this time with an undercurrent of dread, maybe from not knowing what it was. “I think I'm going to be sick.”\n\n“You drink too much at the club or something?” I shook my head. I'd had one beer. And this didn't feel like being drunk, or like a migraine, or like anything else I could label.\n\nIt just felt like something was wrong.\n\n“I need to go lie down,” I said firmly. \n\n] He tousled my hair again, but gently. “Okay, man. Hang on just one sec. I need to see the end of this fucking hallway and then we’ll get you back upstairs.”\n\nI didn’t want him to leave but couldn’t think of any sane reason to stop him[ that didn’t sound needy], so I nodded and let him go. Too many vaguely ill feelings were churning around inside me to sort them out from each other.\n\n“I’ll wait here,” was all I could say, the thought of walking back up twisting stairs feeling for a queasy moment like a bad idea.\n\nHe was already halfway down the hall, but lifted a hand in acknowledgment. Moments later he’d turned the corner and was gone.\n\nIt was suddenly very quiet.\n\nI sunk to a sitting position, knees at my chin, back against the fake wood-paneling. [@alcohol>{i/Why do you always, always drink too much? Idiot.} I tried to focus on|I tried to turn my focus inward, self-diagnose whatever was happening, but my thoughts slipped off the sense of growing unease like a car on black ice, unable to gain traction.

I blinked, squinted.\n\nThe light. The play of light around me had changed, gone darker, even though none of the wall sconces in my field of vision had gone out or gotten dimmer.\n\nWe were at a T-junction, where the hall we’d come from, back to the big room with the five doorways, had branched in two directions. I was slumped against the wall facing the way we’d come, head turned towards the right-hand fork, the way Niko had gone.\n\nI decided the dimming must have come from the lights in the hall behind me, the one we hadn't explored yet. They must have gone out. \n\nCareful, still fighting nausea, I turned my head.\n\n# Some independent variables for the details of this scare scene.\n\n# Who's the figure: Ryan? Niko?

Still, it|I'd felt fine after a good night's sleep, but neither of us seemed in any hurry to head back Downstairs the next day. It] might seem odd that we didn’t go back down there to map the whole thing out right away. I can't really explain it, unless Niko was already feeling the same irrational foreboding as me.\n\n[^{horrorMovieStorySetup} I’d realized this at some point in high school when they were still a kind of macho rite of passage. One of the last ones I watched was a terrible direct-to-video job about a creature that lived in the woods and hunted down the teenagers who kept blithely wandering in. When you finally saw the monster it was a huge let-down---terrible make-up on an even worse actor. But before you saw it on screen, you heard it, and the movie’s whole gimmick, its thing, was that the creature would parrot back anything said to it, in the original voice, flawless. It wasn’t clear if it understood the words, or just mindlessly mimicked the sound. But while it was slaughtering each hapless cheerleader it would repeat her terrified cries for help back to her, perfectly. Would keep screaming in her voice even after she’d died.\n\nThat concept settled into my brain and ate away at me for weeks, though I couldn’t explain why it was so terrifying. Why should the worst thing to hear from a dark woods at night be not snarls or growls or witchy laughter, but your own voice, yourself? And yet it was. A few weeks later I jerked awake well after midnight certain something was standing in the shadows of my room, and as I reached out frantic for my lamp I knocked it off the nightstand and it crashed to the floor, the bulb shattering with a tinkle, and I stupidly called out “Is someone there?” and as I did I realized if I heard it repeated back to me from the shadows it would be the end of me, a clean break through my sanity, even if it was a joke or a prank or a hallucination{ch2PossiblesAddendum}, and as I clutched my blanket too terrified to go to the light switch on the wall I prayed, pleaded with my brimful imagination not to choose that moment to overflow, to improvise, to believe in things that weren’t really there, like it had each time I’d read too much into smiles or gestures, each time I’d watched vivid movies play in my head sprung from single sentences in books or looked at clouds and seen, really seen, fantastic shapes in them, and I’m pretty sure that was the exact moment I decided horror movies weren’t for me.]\n[MACRO horrorMovieStorySetup][@possibles>Another thing my overactive imagination had ruled out for me was horror movies.|I've always spooked too easy. Horror movies, for instance, were an absolute no-go.]\n[MACRO ch2PossiblesAddendum][@possibles> or, dear god, a {i/possible} my brain had decided to believe in at that precise moment]\n\nAnyway. I knew there wasn’t really anything down there, Downstairs, and as the [@alcohol>hangover|memory] faded so did the lingering terror. Replacing it was a giddy sensation like having too much [^Halloween] candy. There was a whole huge secret basement under our house that only we knew about[, Niko and I]. It felt good to have [a|another] secret. Another code in our personal dictionary, something only for us.\n\nNiko was terrible at [^keeping] secrets. By next afternoon, all the other housemates had seen Downstairs too, as well as a couple of his [baseball|basketball|lacrosse] buddies and one or two of his closest [philosophy|board game|chess] buddies. (He'd made a point of changing majors and hobbies once a quarter for the past year, while continuing to swear up and down to his immigrant parents he was still majoring in Economics.) I tried not to take the betrayal personally[^, but kind of failed].\n\nBut the strange thing was that no one seemed much interested. Everyone agreed Downstairs was a cool find, and made for a [sick|great|nice] hangout spot, but no one cared to venture too far outside the big central room, or spend too much time down there. Everyone other than Niko and I would get bored, start talking about other things, eventually drift back upstairs to whatever they'd been doing before.\n\nOdd, in hindsight.\n\n[@furnished>We did end up dusting off a couple of the old couches down there, and moving down|We did end up moving a couple couches down (and it was murder getting them around those tight landings, let me tell you) and] a half-dozen boxes of my records, and made the Big Room available as a kind of secondary hangout space, quieter than the crowded front room with the TV and people always coming and going. Some of the empty rooms off the big one turned into overflow storage for everyone's miscellaneous shit, but remained otherwise unoccupied. \n[^\n\n“Man, y'all could live rent-free,” one of Niko's ex-bandmates said one night while we were down there, poking her head into another lonely room. “Let these out to those poor engineering frosh. They don't see no daylight anyway.”\n\n“Yeah,” I said, “except everyone would have to come in and out through my bed.”\n\n“I mean they wouldn't walk directly over you,” she explained, patting a patronizing hand on my shoulder. “Even though I know that kind of sad sack white boy victim scene is right up your alley. You ask nice, they'll just gently kick you out of the way.”|An old bandmate of Niko's who'd dropped out of college to start an art collective got really excited about free studio space, moved in a bunch of junk for some unfinished sculptural masterpiece (“I'm going to need at least twice this many fishbowls,” she apologized), then never came back again. Maybe it was a con.]\n\nI [didn’t get on well with most of Niko’s friends.|liked most of Niko's friends, but I don't think the feeling was mutual.] I'm sure they all wondered what he saw in me.\n\n[DEFINE @rooftop]\n# Slight trickiness to ensure we do this scene for the two singular bits.\n[@rooftop>{rooftop scene}|{rooftop false}] Zero natural light is kind of a downer, even for well-adjusted people. Niko made some noise about bringing a girl down sometime. (“Dude, it's a secret make-out lair.

It was supposed to be off-limits but we'd figured out how to get up there one night: another shared secret. Keeping me company was a rusted-out telescope, a hulking cube of HVAC, and a ten-story drop. I wasn't seriously considering anything but took some morbid comfort from having the option at hand.\n\nThe access door creaked open and I looked back with a guilty start, ready to be reprimanded or maybe arrested. But it was only Niko. He came over to sit next to me, pulling out two cigarettes and angling one at me. Uncharacteristically, I accepted. \n\nWe sat there smoking for a long time.\n\n“How did you know I was up here?” I finally asked.\n\nHe shrugged. “Came home and you weren't there. Kinda had a feeling.”\n\nWe sat there looking down the gently sloping hill of campus, its landmarks and avenues made abstract and manageable.

Being down there had the vague flavor of trespassing, the kind where you're not going to get away with it and it'll go bad for you when you get caught. Sneaking into a restricted area at the airport; busting into Area 51. I mean it was our house, right? But Downstairs didn't feel like ours. Enough laughter or booze or noise and the feeling went away, or at least buried itself somewhere deep, where you'd hardly ever notice it.]\n\nMaybe because of that, [^definitely because of day-to-day distractions,|definitely because I had to fill in at my job for two work-studies who faked being sick,] [^maybe also because we enjoyed prolonging the sense of mystery,] and, okay, because I was sulking, more than a week passed before we got around to scoping out the place in depth. Niko spent a day in an extraordinary funk of fierce depression followed by an equally intense reversal, like he'd do from time to time, and I took advantage of his high to prod him into going to [catalog|explore|scope out|poke around] [the rest of] Downstairs. He took to this plan eagerly, and seemed pleased when I told him I’d been waiting so we could do it together. “Ryan,” he said fondly, “in an emergency, you know, you can do things without me. I’ll allow it.” \n\n“Well, I kind of thought this was like, our thing, you know.”\n\nHe fell onto one knee. “Oh, my noble Orion,” he intoned, “canst thou e’er forgive such rank betrayal, breaking this our vow of secrecy? Will thy gentle heart recover---”\n\n“Okay, okay,” I said, waving my hand. “Get over yourself.”\n\nHe leapt up with a wicked grin, made himself a pot of coffee, put on a truly awful and unseasonable Christmas sweater, and headed Downstairs with me to map out what was down there.\n\nExcept we couldn't.\n\nWe'd grabbed flashlights in case of dark corners or burnt-out bulbs, but didn't need them. Every hall was lit by those cheerful bright wall sconces, and most of the [side] rooms had a single bare bulb in the center of the ceiling. But it was the damnedest thing. We couldn't find an end to the place. We picked one hallway and wandered around for maybe fifteen minutes, through T-junctions and ninety-degree corners, past dozens of doors and [@furnished>half-furnished|empty] rooms. The same wood-paneled walls, seventies carpet, and wall sconces were everywhere. Downstairs was aggressively bland but disturbingly unbounded. It went from weird to surreal to sort of frightening, how much of it there was. [And this was just one of the five hallways off the central room.]\n\nI'd poked my head into a room with [@furnished>an enormous old bureau---empty, like all the furniture---and] a nook at the far end, a wooden dowel running along the top---like a doorless closet, maybe. I wandered over to investigate, hoping for a few dusty hangers, [the remnants of an old calendar,] some comforting sign of former human occupation. No such luck.\n\nI mean, the place looked like people should have lived there, but [@furnished>aging furniture aside, ] there was almost nothing around to prove it. Anonymous marks scuffed the walls, the odd piece of lint dotted the floor, but there were no height marks penciled on door frames, no piles of old magazines, no bright squares on dirty walls where pictures once hung. Not a single old candy wrapper or forgotten sock. I ran my hand across the wooden dowel and wondered who had put it there, if anyone had ever hung clothes from it.\n\n[I turned around and saw Niko hadn't followed me in. I felt a moment of disorientation. The door seemed a long way away.\n\nNo---blinking, I realized it wasn't that. When I'd turned back toward the doorway, it wasn't there.\n\nI frowned. The doorway was on the other side of the room from the one I'd instinctively turned to. I thought I'd walked along the wall to get to the nook, that it and the door had been on the same side. But the door was on the opposite wall, diagonally across from me.\n\nI closed my eyes, suddenly dizzy. I remembered keeping the faded white wall to my right as I crossed the carpet to the closet nook. But when I looked again, the door was still where it was, in the opposite corner.\n\nObviously it hadn't moved. \n\n{i/You’re doing it again.}\n\n{i/Don’t see things that aren’t there. You fucking idiot.}\n\nPushing away the uneasiness, I crossed diagonally across the carpet to the door, unable as I did to shake the sensation that I was tracing a different path than the one I'd walked coming in.\n\nThat this door led somewhere else.\n\nI pushed my head out into the hallway. It looked just the same. Of course, they all did.\n\n“Niko?” \n|\nThere was a sadness to it all. I thought of my first apartment, the one I'd moved into halfway through senior year of high school for reasons that---well. Reasons. It felt the same way, when I moved in and for most of the nine months I lived there: empty, anonymous. Faded, somehow. Less alive. I couldn't spare any pieces of myself back then to lend it life, make it feel like a home. Maybe none of its earlier tenants had, either. A house without a soul. A year later I'd been glad to move into the dorms, for all their noise and smells and ill-repair, because at least there was no question that people had {i/lived} there.\n\nWhen I turned around, the door back out was gone.\n\nFor a second my heart pounded and my eyes darted around three blank white walls, pupils dilating in shock. I was trapped. There was no way out.\n\nAnd then as I jerked forward in shock, I saw my mistake. The inside of the door was the same color as the walls---even the knob had been painted over, inexplicably---and the angle of the room's single light hid all shadows, so for a minute, from directly opposite, the door had turned invisible. A trick of perspective, and keyed up nerves.\n\n{i/Don’t see things that aren’t there. You fucking idiot.}\n\nNiko hadn't followed me in. I turned the white doorknob and pushed my head out into the hallway, called his name.]\n\nNo answer.\n\n[{i/Okay, that's fine}|{i/Cool}|{i/Perfectly fine and normal}], I thought, keeping a firm grip on myself. I walked down the hall in the direction we'd been headed, peeked around the corner.\n\nMore hall, more carpet, more doors. No Niko.\n\nI shouted his name again, louder.\n\nNothing.\n\nIt was so quiet.\n\nI started down the hall, then halfway down thought maybe I should go back, not forward; then stopped in confusion. If you're lost you're supposed to stay put, not wander around.\n\n[{i/I've never been lost in a basement before.}]\n\nThe knob on the nearest door started to turn.\n\nMy heart tried to jump out my throat. The door thumped. The knob turned the other way, faster, more violent.\n\nWith a shuddery squeal the door burst open, Niko's shoulder leading the rest of him out.\n\n“Stuck,” he said, jiggling the knob. “[^Like the one upstairs. ]Oh, goddammit. I spilled my coffee.”\n\nWe looked down at the new dark stain on the carpet. He licked droplets from his fingers, inspected a candy-caned sweater cuff. “Thank Christ it didn't stain the cashmere.”\n\n“That is {i/not} cashmere,” I said, rolling my eyes. “Hey. Don't wander off on me like that.”\n\n[^I didn't want to admit how spooked I'd been, and thought I'd done a good job hiding it, but of course he knew me better than that. He stared into me and seeing those emerald eyes full of concern was enough to melt my fear, transmute it into something infinitely better.\n\n“Okay,” I laughed. “You're not in trouble. Just stay close, yeah?”]\n\n“Sure, and sorry, but hey.” His eyes had a mischievous glint. “Come check it out. I found [some] [more] stairs.”\n\n{section_break}\n\n\n\nThe new stairs led down into darkness. From the top we could see about twenty or thirty steps before things got shadowy, and enough of the shadows to tell the stairs kept descending for a while after that.\n\nNiko had been excited to show me, but now he perched uneasily on the top step. I got out my flashlight and switched it on, pointing down. “Come on. Maybe there's some answers down there.” He still looked hesitant. I put on my straightest face and my best P.I. voice. “Don't you want to get... to the bottom of this?”\n\n“Mmm.” He frowned in concern. “I just wouldn't want your boyfriend to get jealous, me spending all this time down here with you.”\n\nThis was a little joke of his. I didn't have a boyfriend.\n\nBut he flicked on his own light, waved me on. “After you, amigo.”\n\nThere were [maybe|about] [eighty|ninety|a hundred] steps. Other than that, and the fact that we were lighting our way with flashlights, they seemed like any other stairs in a house built during the [Carter|Ford|Nixon] administration and sinking into senility. That same damn carpet. They must have bought up the whole factory.\n\nThe wall sconces were still there, but no longer lit. Still no light switches anywhere.\n\nWhen the stairs finally gave out, it was into another hallway, nearly identical to the ones above. This one felt a bit [bigger|smaller], and the carpet a darker shade, looking more brown now, though maybe both impressions were a trick of the flashlights. [Funny how much light influences your perception of spaces, of shapes. Colors. Everything, really.]\n\nMore rooms opened off this hall, though these had more variety. A few doors were locked, which we hadn't encountered on the upper level. [@empty>Some of the rooms seemed like bedrooms: a few even had old bed frames and mattresses in them.] I searched the walls in vain for colored tacks with ripped corners of posters still attached, or even a crumpled gas station receipt. [I mean it|It] wasn't like the place was sterile. Another room had a drain in the floor with stains running up to two big utility hookups on the wall, and the faint smells of dust and moths and yellowing wallpaper glue were everywhere. What was missing was anything personal.\n\nThe weirdest room, though, was the kitchen. It was too big for a kitchen, for starters, and had too much stuff in it: too many oven hookups, too much haphazard ceiling ventilation, red-handled water valves everywhere, and a dozen jumbled stove tops with holes where the burners should be. There were parts of appliances but no whole ones: bundles of wiring, even a kitchen sink. Niko tried the faucet and we  both were startled when [hot] water came out. It was like a half-assembled restaurant kitchen with all the equipment jumbled together, rather than a row of stoves here, a row of dishwashers there.\n\nI found what was clearly the plumbing for a toilet hookup in the middle of one wall, and had to put my foot down about this making any sense at all.\n\n“Maybe a wall was supposed to go up here?” Niko shined his light between the bathroom plumbing and the nearest stovetop, but the kitchen stuff extended to either side. \n\n“Who puts a toilet in the middle of a kitchen?” I didn't get it.\n\nHe shrugged.\n\nJust the one door, too, and nothing nearby that might have been a dining room or pantry[, though we did find a large, empty, low-ceilinged room a few doors down. “Not that you could get a dining table down here,” Niko mused. Same brown carpet, but no signs of anything to explain the room's purpose: no ceiling bulb or place to attach one, not even a single electrical outlet.|. A few doors down was a long, narrow room paved entirely in yellow bathroom tile and graying grout. A rust-pitted shower head, two immobile handles, and dirt-clogged drain clustered at one end, thirty feet away from the opposite wall.] \n\n“You get the feeling whoever built this place didn't exactly know a lot about architecture?” Niko's voice was hushed in a kind of reverence. “Everything down here's off, you know? Like, who was that old lady in California who built that house with all the doors that went nowhere and fake hallways and everything?”\n\nSarah Winchester. I told him. Except her house is now an internationally famous tourist attraction. And this place was bigger.\n\n[Someone should have known about this.|Why didn't anyone {i/know} about this?]\n\nNiko was thinking along the same lines. “Seriously, though. Who the fuck built all this? And why? For what?”\n\n“No clue. But if there's any explanation, it's probably down here somewhere.” I even half-believed that, which felt nice.\n\n“I feel weird walking around a crazy person's house.” His eyes darted around the empty room. “Not that I expect, like, pit traps and rotating blades. But it feels sort of... unsafe.” [^He had finished his coffee and was fiddling nervously with the mug, twirling it by the handle back and forth in his fingers.]\n\nHe kept glancing at me like he wanted me to say something that would make him feel better, to save him, so I tried my best like always. “You ever notice old horror movies have lots of really improbable architecture?” I babbled. “I want to meet some of those architects. Probably all dead now but I still want to grab them by their ghostly lapels and ask why the fuck they built all those crawlspaces and secret torture rooms and basements without proper lighting.”\n\n[^“Can we not talk about horror movies right now? Also, ghosts. Maybe just shut up, actually.” But he was grinning.\n\nWe moved on.\n\nThe next door we tried was another locked one. For some reason, I knocked.\n\n“Why did you do that?” Niko hissed. I shrugged, smiling despite myself. But then a weird sensation came over me, like walking on someone's grave. Because as silly as it was, we both couldn't help waiting for a breath or two.\n\nListening.\n\nIsn't that how that expression goes, walking on someone's grave? Or is it someone walking on yours? No, that wouldn't make sense. Never mind.\n\nThere was no answer, of course.]\n\n“You're freaking me out, man,” Niko said. He held the light under his face, washing it out to a ghostly tan as his eyes rolled up into his head. “Vreeaking meee owwwwt.”\n\n“Attractive.”\n\n“You would totally date [undead|zombie] me. Rotting flesh and all. Don't pretend you wouldn't.”\n\n[75>“You're half-skeleton already. There's barely any flesh to rot off you.”\n\n“Come on.” He grabbed my shoulder and propelled me down the hall. “Let’s keep going.” The rough of his hand shocked some courage back into me. My shoulder felt cool when he took the hand away.]\n\n[DEFINE @octagon|@hexagon|@pentagon]\n[MACRO room shape name][@octagon>octagon|@hexagon>hexagon|@pentagon>pentagon]\nA few more paces down the hallway, it opened into [@octagon>an octagonal|@hexagon>a six-sided|@pentagon>a pentagonal] room, a closed door in each wall other than the one we'd entered through. We tried a few. Each door opened onto another staircase leading down.\n\n“But {i/seriously},” Niko said, alarmed. “This cannot possibly be here. It doesn't make sense.” He looked towards me, desperate. “Ryan, help.”\n\n“Okay,” I said, grasping at straws. “Maybe it's like a whole underground network. All the houses in the neighborhood connected together. People used to smuggle drugs or something. Underground railroad.”\n\n“Decor's too new,” he countered. “And we haven't found any other stairs back up.”\n\n[“Bomb shelter. Last owner decided to modernize.

Program got relocated to Washington along with all the lonely housewives when Clinton was elected.”]\n\nHe shook his head. “Let's go back, man. I don't like this. Something's not right.”\n\n[I peered down one of the dark stairwells, frustrated. It bothered me that we might be so close to figuring this out. The next door might open onto something that explained it all.\n\nAnd an undercurrent of excitement cut through the tinge of fear. This was fun. We were exploring. On a quest together. \n\nI didn't want it to end.]\n\n“It can't go on forever,” I said. “And whatever's deepest down will be most interesting, right?”\n\nI talked him into it. [It didn't take that much doing. He felt the same pull as me. And there|After all there] was nothing dangerous down here: it wasn't like exploring an abandoned mine shaft. Everything was in perfect repair even if no one seemed to have been here for years.\n\n[“Solid enough,” Niko said, poking at the wall. “Just not a lot of, you know. Ambiance.”|Big as it was, it was only architecture.]\n\nThe staircase we picked dropped down for a few dozen steps, then turned at a weird angle and dropped some more. It wasn't necessarily smaller but felt more claustrophobic. Maybe that was my brain reminding me how deep underground we must be getting. At most of the landings a new hall branched off, each at a different angle. We kept going down.\n\nAfter four or five weird angled twists the stairs ended, opening up into another corridor. [This one felt different, though I couldn't put my finger on why. The texture of the carpet, maybe, or something changed in the wall paneling. Like a new decorator working to the same plans.|Everything felt exactly the same, despite being stories deeper underground. It was as bland and anonymous as office space in a skyscraper.]\n\nThere were more doors.\n\nWe shuffled past them, flashlights glinting off doorknobs and---{i/there} was a difference---instead of the wall sconces, fake candelabra now. You know the ones, with those awful faux-candles that flicker orange and don't fool anyone? They weren't lit now, anyway.\n\n[It's hard to explain the quiet. It felt complete in a deeper way than absence of sound. Like we were far away from anything that made noise, other than us. I guess we were.]\n\nWe stopped less to try side doors now, eager to get to the end of the hall, or the end of something, at least. Find some answers.\n\nFor a long stretch there were no doors at all, just wood paneling, so that when we did come to another door it was a relief, like exhaling held breath. Niko tried it, and it swung open onto a room [unlike anything|like nothing] we'd seen so far.\n\nIt was concrete and tall, with rounded corners at the bottom. The ceiling was higher than the walls, like we were in a pit dug into a bigger room. In the center of the concrete floor was a drain.\n\nNiko, intrigued, grabbed the bottom of a short ladder that ended around shoulder-height and pulled himself up to the top of the pit, flashlight swinging wildly. I clung to mine, keeping it steady like a candle I was afraid would blow out.\n\nI felt afraid, without [quite] knowing why.\n\nHe shined his light back down at me. “Yep,” he said, “it's a swimming pool.”\n\nThat made sense, by some incredibly loose definition. “What's up there?”\n\nHe turned away from the lip, moved out of sight. Patterns of light swam across the ceiling as he swung the flashlight around. Something rattled. “Another kitchen.” His voice bounced oddly off the rounded concrete. “This one's all furnished, though.”\n\nI was getting more and more unsettled, unaccountably so. “Any more doors?”\n\nThe reflections of light moved to and fro, like something alive. “Nope. [No way in or out except through the pool.] And there's no place to sit and eat, either.” He paused. More scuffling. “Funny. The fridge is locked. Like, there's a keyhole on the fridge and you can't open it. Who does that?”\n\nThe door we'd come through, I noticed, was the same as all the others: cheap particle board, regular brass-plated knob. Not especially waterproof. I bent down, pushed it shut. Sure enough, there was a gap between it and the top of the carpet[ outside]. Like you'd expect for any regular door not, you know, at the bottom of a swimming pool.\n\n“Hey, Niko?” I straightened up, keeping my voice steady. “Let's go back.” I wanted to add {i/I don't like this} or maybe {i/I want to get the hell out of here right now}, but some irrational fear gripped me that if I showed any weakness, he'd be the one who wanted to keep going down.\n\nGoing deeper.\n\nSomething rattled up there, wood scraping wood. “There's silverware in these drawers,” he called, as if he hadn't heard me. “Cups in the cabinets too. Super seventies.[75> Like the cups your grandma probably has, you know?][75> I think Barbarella had these cups.]”\n\nHis voice was starting to seem unreal. I felt how tenuous a connection I had to him: a voice, the glints of his flashlight on the ceiling above the empty pool. Echoes and shadows. The distance between us seemed vast and growing vaster, maybe already unbridgeable. [A strange nausea was creeping up on me, an unsettling dizziness, a turning, a skew.]\n\n[@dadphone>I remembered lying in bed as a kid, waiting to be tucked in, and the person I loved most in the world vanishing, between one blink and the next.]\n\nAnd then. Maybe I imagined this, between the weird echoes of that concrete pool bottom and the nerves I'd worked up. But I thought I heard muffled voices. Faint. Coming through the wall.\n\nComing from the other side of the closed door[ back out].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I could see him, I could suddenly even smell him, and that tangible reality felt overwhelmingly reassuring. I grabbed his arm and even his awful not-cashmere sweater was comforting.\n\n“What's up?”\n\n“I thought…” The noise had gone; I felt foolish. “[I thought ]I heard someone out there.”\n\nHe walked to the door, pulling away from me. “No don't!” I hissed, but his hand was already on the knob, he was already turning it, pushing the door open, stepping out into the hallway. Shining his light left, back the way we'd come. He turned, to shine it to the right.\n\nAnd for an instant I was sure\n{verse_inline/something}\naround the corner was going to grab him and in the same instant with nightmarelogic certainty I knew it was my fault for imagining it[@possibles>, for possibling it]\n{verse_inline/for making it real}\nbut nothing happened. He shrugged.\n\n“I don't hear anything, man.”\n\nNeither did I.\n\n“Let's get back anyway,” he said. “[I'm not even sure how long we've been down here.|We've been down here too long.] Your boyfriend's going to kill me.”\n\nAs we walked back up the hall through the zone [without|with no] doors, I [glanced|looked] [behind me|back]. I noticed with a frown we'd left the door to the pool room open.\n\nIt felt wrong, somehow. A bad omen.\n\nBut no way in hell was I walking back to shut it.\n\n{section_break}\n\nWe lay on my closed-again bed and stared up at the ceiling, giggling. We couldn't help ourselves. It felt good to be out of there, to have the whole ridiculous mystery literally at our backs. Even an old mattress felt like shield enough. \n\nI'd felt better with each upward step. The earlier rooms were familiar as we hit them in reverse: the [@octagon>octagon with its stairs down|@hexagon>six-sided room with its stairs down (which Niko kept insisting, incorrectly, was called a sexagon)|@pentagon>pentagon room with its stairs down], the bright yellow light of the upper halls, Niko's coffee stain (“so typical,” I told him, “you've marked this place with your distinctive musk”) and the big empty room with its couches and piles of everyone's junk. By the time we'd climbed the final stairs to my room and swung the bed shut, we were giddy, flushed with excitement, brimming with explanations and theories.\n\n“It must run under the whole neighborhood,” Niko was saying. “Connect to other houses, or maybe it only used to. Maybe no one knows about it any more.” He grinned. “Except us.”\n\n“It doesn't make sense,” I was still protesting, but it felt more [ridiculous than sinister|silly than sinister]. I shook my head, embarrassed by my freak-out earlier. I was spooking myself for no reason. If someone else was down there, wouldn't they have come to say hi?\n\n{i/Maybe they did.}\n\nI shook my head again. It was cool, and nothing was going to get in the way of that.\n\n[DEFINE @nikoblackout]\n[@nikoblackout>Niko jumped off the bed up to his feet, then swayed and put out a hand to touch the wall. I frowned, sitting up. “Okay?” Sometimes he blacked out if he stood up too fast. I worried.\n\n“Yeah, yeah,” he said, waving a hand. “Just need some more coffee. Or booze. Maybe both.”]\n\nI did some legit research in the next few days[, in between shifts at my job in the admin offices working through an endless backlog of filing---this was back when you could still pay tuition at a state college with a part-time job]. Our landlord stopped by to see how we were settling in and reassure us he'd fix the things he said he'd fix before we moved in, which he clearly wasn't going to fix. He was a younger guy with kind of a stoner vibe, on the whole not very plausible as a landlord. When I casually asked how he'd come to acquire a hundred-year-old house in a rather nice college town, he said he was trying to make a living off rental properties and we were the first students to move into this one. He mentioned he'd gotten a good deal on the house because of the maintenance it needed (embarrassed cough) and because the city sold it at auction and they “weren't allowed to play bidding games and shit” with it.\n\n“So the city repossessed it or something? Do you know who owned it before?” I asked, practically exuding casual nonchalance.\n\n[“Old dude,” he said, “no heirs. Just the house, though, not the whole estate. No furniture.” I remembered that from when we moved in: it had led to a lot of scrambling at yard sales and favors involving friends with vans. “Real weird guy,” my landlord added when he saw I was interested, warming to the subject. “Had lived here since forever, I guess. Kind of a shut-in.”\n\n“Oh yeah?”\n\n“What the neighbors said,” he confirmed, and waggled his eyebrows while circling a finger near his ear, but apparently didn't have anything more specific to add.|“Been empty for a long time,” he said. “Was filled up with a ton of junk. Had to cart it all away before listing it.”\n\n“Oh yeah? What kind of junk?”\n\n“Just...” he twirled his hand in a vague circle. “Stuff. Old furniture, old paint, piles of bricks. Nothing valuable.”|“Old lady,” he said, “no heirs. Kind of a weirdo. Didn't have any furniture, you know? Mattress on the floor of the foyer, toiletries and shit, but nothing else. All the other rooms were empty. No art, furniture, nothing. I probably shouldn't be telling you this.” He leaned forward conspiratorially, nevertheless. “Neighbors said she was a real shut-in.”\n\n“Oh yeah?”\n\n“In and out once a week to buy groceries, that was it.” He made a cutting gesture with his hand. “Never talked to anyone. No car. Didn't die here, by the way.” He crossed his heart. “Would have told you that, swear to God. No. Heart attack at the Safeway. And that was it.”|“Rich guy from out of town,” he said. “Hadn't ever lived here, I don't think. Probably hoping this neighborhood was on its way up.” He glanced around the tree-line street skeptically. “Guess he got sick of waiting.”\n\n“Do you know who owned it before that?” I asked, but he only shrugged.]\n\nI didn't ask if he knew anything about a secret basement the size of a city block, because I was afraid our rent would go up.\n\nDown at city hall I looked up the property history, which I'd hoped would be more interesting than the chemistry I should have been studying. The house had indeed been built about a hundred years earlier. The records were aggressively boring. Certainly nothing about enormous sub-basements or a fleet of mining vehicles. I even hunted through microfilm of the local paper for anything unusual the week of construction. No dice.\n\nAfter that, the trail went [a bit] cold because I had another acne flare-up, a bad one, [dropped out of a class instead of showing up to take the midterm|missed a shift at work and got chewed out by my supervisor,] and felt generally miserable about myself for a couple of days. I finally pulled myself together enough to get some groceries and refill the expired prescription on my acne cream. I was in the bathroom, rubbing it on my pockmarked face and thinking about how much I’d been lied to as a kid. {i/Oh, that’ll clear up when you get older.} Also {i/You’ll figure girls out eventually} and {i/There’s someone out there for everyone}. Classics, all.\n\nNiko popped his head around the corner. “Dude. Phone’s for you.” He blinked at me. “You realize when you do that, it looks like you’re rubbing jizz all over your face.”\n\nI didn’t really see it. The last thing I thought about when looking in the mirror was anything sexy.\n\nHe must have guessed what I'd been thinking, because he punched my shoulder. “Dude, get over yourself. You’re not Quasimodo.” He sighed. “We need to get you a boyfriend.”\n\n“Store was fresh out,” I said, but grimly resolved to start wearing my pride bracelet out in public again. “Who’s on the phone?”\n\n“Some lady from the local history society? I thought she had the wrong number, but she asked for you by name.”\n\nI had in fact called the history society a few days earlier, and the voice on the phone [turned out to be|was|belonged to] an elderly woman who breathlessly said she’d love to chat about the old houses in our neighborhood, and invited us over to the society office for a cup of tea. The office turned out to be her living room. We sat on a sun-faded couch sipping something tasteless while she fawned over us (“so {i/wonderful} to see young people take an interest in local history”). It was awkward. I asked if she knew anything interesting about our address or any people who used to live there. She wasn't familiar with the house, although the mayor had once lived on our street, she told us, and she thought most of the houses near there had been built around the same time. Flailing, I asked if she knew anything about tunnels or underground rooms around town. She spun a not-very-interesting story about how during Prohibition a local bootlegger had dug a tunnel that led from his basement all the way to a poplar in the neighbor's backyard---nearly fifty feet long. I smiled and nodded [demurely] until I found a way to excuse us.\n\nMeanwhile Niko had been making excursions on his own. I got kind of upset when he told me---I'd wanted it to be our thing, something we did together---but he said he'd come get me the instant he found anything interesting, and didn't make too big deal out of it. It really bothered me, though. I thought about going on my own too but it felt wrong without him there. I itched with overwhelming curiosity but also a certain dread that kicked my heartbeat up a notch when I thought about walking too far down those halls, those stairs. I told myself I was being stupid but my pulse didn't listen.\n\nNiko spitballed the idea of making a map, but figured it would be tricky. “A lot of those angles are non-standard,” he said. “Those funny twists on the stairs down from the [@octagon>octagon|@hexagon>sexagon|@pentagon>pentagon], right? They're more than ninety degrees but less than the next sensible unit---one thirty-five or whatever. I have a feeling if you measured them they'd be fractional. Like one twenty nine point two three eight three eight.” He laughed. “Three eight three eight three eight three eight three---”\n\n“Quit it.[@hexagon> Also, Romeo, it's ‘hexagon.']”\n\nHe smirked. “Irrational.”\n\nSome of the halls sloped up or down, too, enough that you could feel it when you walked them. Keeping track of what level everything was on would add to the confusion. I dragged discussion back up to the bigger picture. “It has to be mostly running east, doesn't it? Because of the hill. That big stairway doesn't go down far enough to get under 12th Street.”\n\n“I don't know.” He visualized with closed eyes for a moment, then shrugged and opened them, shaking his head. “Hard to keep a sense of direction down there. We'll bring a compass next trip. You think those new GPS things for hiking would work?”\n\n“No, they need line of sight to the sky. We could leave breadcrumbs, like Hansel and Gretel.”\n\n“We might have to, if it's much bigger.” His eyes widened. “Can you imagine getting lost? Like some estate agent's nightmare. ‘My god, I'll never be able to replace all this carpet!'”\n\nWe had a party down there. By unspoken agreement, the housemates didn't advertise the extent of the place: I put police caution tape from the dollar store across all the doorways out of the big room, as a joke, though I suspected I wasn't really joking. It was fine if everyone just saw a chill basement hangout spot. Much levity was made from the fact that you had to climb in and out of my bed to get there, or to go back up and take a piss.\n\nWe brought down a foosball table, some Christmas lights, lots of booze, and the stereo. I protested that my record collection was for archival purposes, not playing at parties, but [I was overruled|Niko put his hands on my shoulders and looked deep into my eyes and said please, and that was all it took]. It was an okay turnout and everyone, for all the usual reasons, focused on getting good and drunk. My usual social ineptness kept me from truly enjoying myself. Some girl tried to hit on me; I was so startled by this I blurted “Actually, I'm gay,” which was even more awkward out loud than it sounds written down, and she laughed noisily and commiserated about the tragic ironies of dating for a few embarrassing seconds before vanishing, and only too late did I think to ask what the hell had compelled her to talk to me in the first place, because certainly whatever it was had never worked on any guys.\n\nNot that I’d figured out how to go to parties where guys who’d be interested would hang out, anyway. I hated dance clubs and the couple gay bars I’d stepped into had given me massive anxiety attacks; I still felt a rush of panic when I thought about walking through the door of the tiny LGBT center on campus, even after years of passing it on the way to classes. I’d always thought things would get easier in college. At my enormous high school there hadn’t been a single out queer person[@bradphone> my freshman year, and I'd had no intention of being|, and I sure as hell wasn’t going to be] the first. Not only because of crippling shyness, self-image issues, and fear for my actual life, but because I literally did not know how to come out. Ellen hadn’t done it on national TV yet when I was in high school; Kevin Kline hadn’t done it at the movies, let alone sultry-eyed Jake Gyllenhaal; not enough gay teens had been famously killed or killed themselves to inspire anyone to tell us It Gets Better. Gay people basically did not exist in my universe, and yet there was I, somehow, gay regardless. College was supposed to have been an improvement. But once I got there, I failed to blossom into a beautiful flower. Maybe I should have moved farther away, to an actual big city, rather than somewhere close by and familiar and still red-state as fuck: but the problem wasn’t my environment, I came to realize, it was me. It wasn’t that I had issues with being gay: the internet had given me plenty of opportunities to come to terms and feel okay about it. I just didn’t know how to be it in public, with other people, on any level but especially a romantic one[@dadphone>. I’d never dated or even asked anyone out, and more and more it felt too late to start.|, especially after what had happened in high school.]\n\nMeanwhile the straight people were having a nice party. Niko, wearing a blue bowling shirt with “My Name is BONG” stitched into the lapel and a pair of tight-fitting lime-green jeans, [whose only virtue was the tight-fitting part,] was shadowing some girl he'd been trying to hit it off with. It wasn't going well. They got into an argument early in the evening (Dear {diary}: I tune out when I hear the phrase “That's {i/not} what Marx said”) and she stormed off up the stairs. Niko fumed, then stormed off himself, reappearing minutes later in a Linkin Park t-shirt and torn jeans and carrying a bottle of tequila, which he used like a police baton to corral me into [@convopit>the conversation pit|a corner] to do shots with him. \n\n“Said I dress too fucking weird for her,” he said with a hollow Ashes to Ashes sort of intonation. “Is {i/this} fucking normal enough? Whatever. [@convopit>It's occupied!” he snapped at someone ambling over with a goofy smile, who promptly lost it and fucked off. He raised a glass to me. “The hell with everyone,” he intoned.|The hell with everyone.”] I could drink to that. We threw back a shot, [@convopit>backs against the carpeted wall of the pit|sitting on the carpet with our backs to the paneled wall]. Niko was always swinging between extremes: at high ebbs he wanted to be friends with everyone, at low ebbs I was the only person in the universe. He was busy furiously ignoring the rest of the party, which I wasn't feeling much connection to either.\n\nHe sniffed. “You know when we first moved over here I didn’t speak any English?” I nodded; I’d heard this story before. “My parents thought it’d be cute to dump me into third grade like that. You know, {i/full immersion}.” His face twisted.\n\nI poured him another shot, thinking I probably shouldn't, but by then I already had.\n\nHe leaned back against the wall, looking worn down. “I tried so fucking hard to fit in. To get to where just opening my mouth didn’t mark me out as a freak. By the time junior high started none of the new kids even knew. Master fucking performance.” He tugged at the t-shirt, a corner of his mouth twitching. “Meanwhile the fam all expects things to be exactly like we’d never left. Like America’s just a little rest stop, like of course I’ll want to go back to Greece and have a million kids as soon as I graduate. My aunt asked me at Thanksgiving why I wasn't married yet. I reminded her I am twenty-two years old and still in the middle of fucking college.[ I didn’t say fucking.” He held the shot glass up to the light, squinting at it suspiciously. “Anyway.|” He sipped at the shot, winced. “Urgh. Never sip tequila.” He held it up to the light, squinted suspiciously. “Anyway.|] She said neither of those things stopped my uncle.” \n\nI was staring idly at a dark-haired girl and a bearded jock flirting on the couch across the room, words swallowed up by the thumping of the stereo. Thinking about the music echoing down all those empty halls. “I can't even imagine getting married.”\n\n“Yeah, neither can the government.”\n\n“Not just that, asshole.” I side-kicked him, then frowned, trying to figure out what I wanted to say[, how deep I wanted to go. Fuck it. I let the tequila talk]. “I don't know. I can't imagine anyone wanting to spend the rest of their life with me. Or that I could believe someone would say yes, if I wanted to with them.” \n\nI closed my mouth, feeling stupid, but he was nodding. “Yeah, I dig you. Thinking you could be that for someone. Believing in yourself that much.” He was frowning. “I can't believe in anything they fucking want me to be.”\n\nHe tilted his head back, eyes closed. “Well, you ever make it there, you got a best man lined up at least.” He opened one skeptical eye. “Or are there two best men? How would all that even work?”\n\n“I don't know.” I closed my eyes, too. {i/Dear $diary. Figure out how all that even works.}\n\nWe listened to the music for a minute, surrounded by people who naturally knew how to Saturday night, without training. It was kind of nice being near them, at least.\n\n[*Ch3PartyConvo*@dadphone>Niko said, very quiet: “You think there's something wrong with me?”\n\nI opened my eyes, looked at him. His were still closed. The flashing Christmas lights were lost in his black curls, more swallowed up than reflected by them. \n\nA corner of his mouth lifted. “Stupid question.”\n\n“You'll make it,” I said, more because I wanted him to believe it than because I’d given it any real thought. \n\nI'd rarely seen his face at rest like this, without its usual mask of social engagement---he liked to play gracious host, loudmouthed philosopher---and the strong curves of his prominent jaw, his sharp nose, seemed fragile in the shifting light. Sharp, but delicate. Able to be shattered.\n\n“Not fucking likely.” His brow furrowed, but then his face relaxed. He downed the rest of the shot, clinked his empty glass against mine, and leaned into me, just a little. “Nice to have someone around to humor me, though. Keep doing that, yeah?”\n\n“No problemo,” I said, leaning into him, too.\n\n|@bradphone>\n\nNiko said, very quiet: “Can't get married till you go on at least one date.”\n\n“Thanks,” I said. “Good tip.”\n\n“For reals, though. You need to put yourself out there, man. Get over whatever hang-ups you got going on.”\n\n“New topic.” I moved to pour myself another shot. He grabbed the bottle, held it out of reach.\n\n“Nuh uh. Confession time. I went, now it's your turn.”\n\n“Fuck you.”\n\n“Seriously, man.” He sat up straighter, fixed me with that look that told me I wasn't getting it. “I know you've dated before. In high school, right? Wasn't his name Brandon or something?”\n\n“Bradley,” I said against my will, something inside me deflating. I still didn't want to tell him, but realized I was going to.\n\n“So what happened? Bad breakup?”\n\nI closed my eyes, not wanting to rip open these scabs. Not on a Saturday night I'd almost been enjoying.\n\n“I broke up with him,” I said quietly, but it was enough for it all to start coming out. “Yeah, okay. The story. So I knew him from band, and he cornered me after practice one day. Someone told him I was into weird old music too. He's got all these bizarro cross-genre mix tapes in his backpack, pulls some out to play for me. Adorable. We hung out in the band room listening to them for hours after everyone else had gone home.”\n\nI sighed. “It took me a while to figure out the signals he was sending because I had no idea how to, like, receive them. But we figured it out in the end. It was, you know. All that first love stuff. Sneaking out at midnight. Lots of giggling. It was amazing. At first.”\n\n“Uh oh.” Niko slouched back down, settling in for the long haul.\n\nI tried to keep talking even though I could feel myself clenching up, chest muscles trembling. “It just became apparent pretty quick that he was way, way more into me than I was into him. He {i/loved} me with every part of himself”---I could feel Niko's eyebrows waggling but I pressed on, knew I couldn't stop the story now---“and it was so fierce it was... like being burned. It {i/hurt}, that I couldn't love him back like that. I didn't know how to take it. And then one day at lunch in the cafeteria I was going to break up with him and I think he sensed it coming, wanted to stop it. So he---oh god.” I closed my eyes and, yup, there they were: moisture squeezed out between them. “We weren't out, you know. In our town. At our school especially. Nobody was. He stands up on the table, little Bradley Thompson, shouts for attention, shouts in a louder voice than I'd ever heard him use that we're in love, that we didn't care who knew it, that our love would last forever and nobody in the universe could stop it.”\n\n“Shit,” Niko breathed.\n\nI took a quick breath. “I don't really remember the rest of that day. I know we got sent to the principal's office because that's where my mom picked me up from. There were adults in the cafeteria so I don't think anyone tried anything, but I'm sure the reaction would have been... laughter. Disgust. Thrown banana peels. Maybe some kids would have thought about stopping it, standing up, supporting us, but I doubt anyone actually did, would have dared. But I don't remember. It's all blank. Just... the aftermath.”\n\n“Yeah?”\n\n“We broke up,” I said, “and I want to talk about that part even less.” I pulled the bottle out of his loose fingers and finally poured the shot, downed it. \n\n“That is the worst coming out story I've ever heard.”\n\n“Not really.” I shrugged. “I didn't get kicked out of my house. Didn't get sent to the emergency room{alcohol Bradley addendum} “So look, just so you know. Dating is generally speaking a lot better than that.”\n\n“So I hear.” My mood was bottoming out into pitch-black despondency. “Haven't really worked up the enthusiasm to find out, though.”\n\nFrom the corner of my eye I could see him looking at me, the flashing Christmas lights lost in his black curls, more swallowed up than reflected by them. He seemed fragile in the shifting light. Sharp, but delicate. Able to be shattered. I knew he was trying to think of something encouraging to say and all at once I couldn't stand the thought.\n\nI pushed out words. “Can we just, like. Not talk any more.”\n\n“No problemo.” He slumped back against the wall. But he leaned into me, just a little. I leaned into him, too.\n]\n[MACRO alcohol Bradley addendum][@alcohol>. Guess that was probably when I started drinking, though. I was a good kid before that.”\n\n“You've always been a good kid,” he said, managing not to make it sound like an insult.|.”\n\n“I mean. Still,” he said.]\n\nWe stayed like that for a few minutes.\n\nThen some friends of his tromped down the stairs and he [@convopit>clambered out of the pit|leapt up], pulling a sparkling smile and manic laugh out from somewhere, pouring drinks and giving high fives, and dragged me with him into the noise, and one of his friends talked me into getting trounced at foosball, and everyone kept drinking. And the moment between us faded into ephemera and lost any possible significance, even to me.\n\n[Like all the ones that had come before, I'd let it slip away.]\n\nNot long after, Niko disappeared. I figured maybe he'd gone back to his room to be alone: despite appearances, his social energy was limited, had to be rationed. I didn't think anything of it[@alcohol>, focused on getting drunk with everyone else because it seemed like the thing to do].\n\nMidnight passed, unnoticed.\n\nSome time later the party started winding down. Soon it had winnowed to a couple hardcore foosballers, the girl and the beardy dude making out on the couch, and a few sozzled, earnest conversations in corners. [@convopit>Someone threw up in the conversation pit. I cleaned it up, but on my way upstairs to throw out a ruined roll of paper towels|I extracted myself from one of these, but on my way upstairs to take a leak] I noticed that the flashlight we'd left by the hall---the one that led to the [@octagon>octagon room, |@hexagon>sexagon---hexagon---whatever---and |@pentagon>pentagon room, ]the long stairs, and the pool---was gone.\n\nHad he gone exploring? Tonight?\n\nIf he had, he'd been gone a long time.\n\nAn hour later the party had just about wrapped. Still no sign of Niko. I'd checked his bedroom---empty---and polled a few housemates. No one had seen him since the start of the night. [@alcohol>I felt a stab of guilt for getting so wasted, for not looking out for him; pushed down vague resentments at feeling like I had to.|I worried.]\n\nI was standing at the hallway wondering if I should go look for him, when a shadow appeared at its end and my body tried to jump out of my skin.\n\nIt was him, of course. But my relief only lasted for a second. As he got closer, a prickling sense crept into my bones that something was wrong. \n\n[He was stepping carefully, like over ice, deliberate, head turned down to the carpet. For a moment I wasn't sure it was him at all.\n\nHe noticed me, gave me the thinnest of smiles. Sweat beaded on his face, which was ashen, like he'd been throwing up{maybe cp too}. He grabbed my arm as if to keep from falling over. His hand was cold.\n\n“You okay?” I asked.\n\nHe nodded. “Yeah. Just need to go to bed.”\n\n“Did you---” I wanted to say {i/see something down there}, but couldn't quite work up the nerve. “---have too much to drink or something?”\n\nHe chuckled, weak. “Bed.” He brushed passed me, and headed, wobbly, up the stairs.|\n\nHe grinned when he saw me, but it was forced, and he was walking too fast. His face was beaded with cold sweat, and he was ashen, like he'd been throwing up{maybe cp too}.\n\nHe gave me a jaunty wave as he got close, but didn't slow down.\n\n“You okay?” I asked.\n\n“Peachy,” he said. “Going to bed though.”\n\n“Did you---” I wanted to say {i/see something down there}, but couldn't quite work up the nerve. “---have too much to drink or something?”\n\nHe clapped my shoulder as he passed, but didn't look at me, and didn't respond: just kept moving, as fast as possible while still making it look like a casual stroll, toward the stairs. The way back up.]\n[MACRO maybe cp too][@convopit> too]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

If I brought it up he'd change the subject; if folks were hanging out down there he wouldn't come. When I finally asked him directly about this, he shook his head.\n\n“I don't think it's a good idea to be down there, that's all.” He tried to play it off casual, but his jaw was set.\n\nSomething about him had changed. His wardrobe turned straight-laced. He went back to calling himself Nick. He watched a lot of sports on TV. [@singular05>He started hanging out with different people: friends from a business development class named Martin and Alicia, and some guy from the Russian dance club named Rostov who had trouble with his English language understanding, especially pronoun referents, and was also, for some reason, obsessed with Tom Cruise. They had spirited arguments about startup ideas and the nature of human consciousness, whether you could write code to fool someone into believing they were talking to a real person, but I wasn't invited. Niko didn't seem to remember I existed. {pp}]\nAnd things were strange between us. Our conversations didn't go quite right, didn't fit in their familiar grooves. We'd get derailed, trail off. We started talking less. I couldn't point to something specific that had changed, but the usual pleasurable tension between us, the taut bond of connection we'd had since the accident, was gone. He didn’t seem to need me any more. He seemed like just a dude. Just a Nick. Not mine.\n\nI worked up my courage and did a few of my own solo expeditions Downstairs, without telling him, but I couldn't convince myself to go very far. I hallucinated strange noises around corners: floorboards creaking, whispered sighs. I knew I was only scaring myself, but didn’t have it in me to stay down there for long.\n\n[*Ch4Interlude*@cdrom>I retreated instead into a game I'd bought a few months back but never made much progress with, a CD-ROM adventure set on a space station orbiting a massive, distant star. Apparently cribbing from {i/Solaris}, you played a new arrival sent to investigate why all the scientists had gone crazy and stopped sending back data. You did this by wandering the station's endless metal halls---the transition animations got reused {i/a lot}---knocking on the scientists' doors, and watching tiny video clips of them ranting through narrow metal slots they'd slide open to talk to you. Most would play the same few clips over and over, but some had a surprisingly broad selection. There were a huge number of doors and scientists, and you had access to all of them right from the start: the game's puzzles didn't seem to prevent you from getting to any part of the station.\n\nThe game was hypnotic but frustrating. Each level of the station was on its own CD, and sometimes when you swapped them it would crash, resetting progress since your last save. It would also sometimes crash when you knocked on a scientist's door, instead of playing the right video clip---something about a QuickTime corruption error. Worse, it often wasn't clear whether the puzzles were broken or just mysterious. They consisted of weird alien artifacts that seemed to litter the halls at random: you could always walk right by them, but if you clicked them you'd get a zoomed-in view of their incomprehensible surfaces. Clicking various components or protrusions would produce odd sound effects, morphing animations, or, most of the time, nothing. Sometimes clicking part of a puzzle would take you back to the hall view, as if you'd clicked away. As far as I could tell none of my fiddling had ever done anything. I kept waiting for some clue or Rosetta stone that would help begin to make sense of the alien artifacts. It never came. Either it wasn't there or I was missing it. Nothing the scientists said in their video clips related to the puzzles, either: they each seemed trapped in their own hallucinatory world of inner demons, and their delusional ramblings didn't seem connected to each other or the plot, if there even was one. The whole thing was so gloriously baffling that the game became a mild obsession for a while, a surreal distraction to fill the hours I was no longer spending with Niko.\n\nEventually I went looking for hints on the internet. I found a Yahoo directory page for the game which listed half a dozen fan sites, some of them as obtuse and labyrinthine as the game itself, all riddled with under-construction gifs, hand-drawn maps, questionably relevant web rings, and elaborate self-insert fanfics, or long rants about {i/what it all meant} peppered with links to freud.com. The game's fans certainly had a type. Curiously, while many of the fan sites promised that full guides or walkthroughs were coming soon, none of them seemed to actually have any, and I started to wonder if it wasn't just me having trouble with the puzzles. Maybe no one had solved them. Maybe the game was so broken it was impossible to beat. I finally uninstalled it and used the hard disk space for {i/Warcraft II}, which was less existentially terrifying. \n\n|\n\nI lay on my bed a lot and listened to records through my headphones. My dad’s old headphones: huge bulky black things with a coiled cord like old telephones. Sometimes I held my breath while I did it. This was an old technique of mine to shut the world out. After a while outside sounds would slip away, and the thrum of blood and music would fill my ears, become my entire universe. As a kid I could hold my breath for three minutes. Enough sometimes to make it through a whole song without breathing.\n\nI fell asleep one night doing this, headphones on, and dreamed about Niko, which happened now and then whether I wanted it to or not. In the dream I was at the hallway junction again, looking down into the shadows at the figure at its end. {nikodreamdetail} walking toward me. Not hesitant but confident, smiling, happy to see me. I grinned back, thrilling at the reciprocity between us, a bond that felt in that moment tinged with something else, something more primal.\n\nBut then I faltered, because I realized I wasn’t sure quite what that meant. There are a lot of primal emotions.\n\nThere were so many things that smile could mean.\n\nI took a step back, afraid, but there was nothing but empty space behind me. I was standing at the lip of a drop-off. {maybe convo pit bit}\n\nHe came right up to me, Niko, my Niko, looking into my eyes with something I was certain now was love, and the fear faded as he reached up to touch my cheek, and the warmth of it and the smell of him and the look on his face fused inside me into need so intense it parted my lips, as if for oxygen, just as he bent down with hunger to kiss them.\n\nIt was a beatific kiss, velvet, brain-melting, the kind you sometimes get in real life if you’re lucky but I’d only ever had in dreams, sweet and lingering and seraphic. Everything I’d ever wanted flowed through me into him and I imagined I could feel the same from him to me, echoed and amplified, conjoined. It went on and on and on. He pressed against me, arms wrapped around my back, holding me, and mine were maybe around him too but only limply, subconscious, the kiss and its indescribable tangibility, its dream-forgotten trueness the only thing, the only thing. The only thing.\n\nIt wasn’t until I’d broken it, pulled back to look up at him, that I realized I was leaning back over the edge behind me, his arms holding me there, my toes the only thing still touching the lip of the drop-off.\n\nI couldn’t read his expression. Had no idea what it meant at all.\n\nI didn’t even know who he was.\n\nHe let me fall.\n\nI plummeted down into darkness, gathering speed, faster and faster. I’d had dreams before that ended like this, a sickening fall and then an ejection back to wakefulness right as I hit ground, covered in cold sweat and shuddering. But this time when I woke, it was more like I’d chosen to do it, pulled away from the dream against its will. Like part of me knew if I’d stayed I’d have kept falling forever, because there was no ground down there to stop me.\n\nThe record was turning in its final groove. I stared at it dumbly, dad’s big headphones still muffling the outside world, transmitting only hissing, clicks and pops.\n\n{i/This has got to stop}, I told myself, {i/you're over him. You got over him a long time ago.} The accident had confused everything but in the months after it I'd sorted myself out, realized it was never going to happen. Put it away and moved on. I had. It was just my fucking dreams didn't seem to have gotten the memo. \n\nI felt Downstairs tingling at my back, beneath me. I switched the player off and took my blanket to sleep on the couch in the living room.]\n\n[MACRO nikodreamdetail][@justRyan>Only this time it wasn’t me down there, it was him,|@justNiko>It was him again,|@ryanAndNiko>There was only one this time: Niko,]\n[MACRO maybe convo pit bit][@convopit>The conversation pit, only now it had no floor. The carpeted sides went down forever.]\n\n{section_break}\n\nOne night not long after that, everyone but Niko and I [went out to a concert|went out to a basketball game|had left for an overnight road trip]. We started drinking, and it seemed to ease the friction between us, which made us both want to keep drinking. I [found|took] comfort in this, maybe the first acknowledgment that he felt the gap between us too, wanted as much as [me|I did] to find a way to close it.\n\n[DEFINE @movieline|@songlyric]\nDeep into a bottle of vodka, we got into one of those hilarious drunken arguments about nothing: [@movieline>the final line to one of our favorite movies|@songlyric>a line from one of our favorite songs]. I was sure it was one thing, he was sure it was something a few words off. I knew I was right, and also could see why he might remember it wrong, but he refused to believe me. He tried to pull out his cell phone to call a friend for a second opinion and got it stuck on something in his pocket: laughing, he ended up dumping everything out on the table, but then we got distracted by a text he'd gotten from an ex-girlfriend, which led to more drinking and another argument where I dutifully tried to keep him from responding, not just because he was drunk [^and she was terrible for him] but because back then with those flip phones it would have taken him a fucking hour to peck out a reply.\n\nWe ended up slumped in our chairs, the vodka bottle empty, listening to some spacey ambient music on the stereo.\n[25>\n\n“Niko,” I said, or maybe the vodka said it for me. “The other night. At the party.”\n\n“What about it?” he muttered, eyes closed.\n\nI couldn't say what I wanted to say. Words come easy until you find the ones that won't come at all, that could shatter unexamined concords in seconds, weaken load-bearing truths. We have universes in our heads that we live in, and the wrong words puncture them, burn them up like airships filled with something unspeakably combustible but  embarrassingly common. Dear {diary}: Oh, the humanity.\n\nEven the vodka couldn't figure out how to navigate all that. I stayed silent for a long time, until I heard Niko gently snoring. Too late, again, as always. I hadn't yet found the right headspace for this conversation, was perpetually too sober to start it or too drunk to finish.\n\nI started to drift off myself, but then|^I had about drifted off when I]\nshook myself awake. Niko was out cold. Before I could wake him and convince him to drag himself to bed I noticed something out of the corner of my eye.\n\nIn the pile of stuff he'd pulled from his pocket (phone, wallet, keys, crumpled receipts) were two small brass keys.\n\nThey weren't on his keyring, just loose in his pocket, and faintly corroded with age.\n\nIt was hard to tell for sure, but they looked identical.\n\nNothing about this was all that unusual but somehow I knew one of those keys would fit the fridge Downstairs. Don't ask how I knew this, because I couldn't tell you, but I did. Irrational.\n\nThat ridiculous locked fridge in that ridiculous kitchen atop a ridiculous empty pool.\n\nHe'd been keeping something from me[30> too].\n\nHad he found something in there? [{pp}] Something that scared him off going back?\n\nWhat inside a fridge could be that scary? Could make him lie to his best friend?\n\nI'm not sure why I did it. The vodka, maybe. Repressed curiosity. Or maybe the growing frustration that something had happened to Niko, something had changed; but I wasn't allowed to know what it was, or ever put it right.\n\nQuietly, I took the keys. I shouldn't have, but by then I already had.\n\n{section_break}\n\nThe house was dead quiet, which made the transition to Downstairs feel even more natural. Despite my earlier trepidations, I wasn't afraid as I grabbed the flashlight by the hallway. Vodka is magic.\n\nI passed through the first few hallways, the stairs where the lights went out, the dark lower corridors. It wasn't until I hit the {room shape name} that I got scared again.\n\nI'd been walking on autopilot, lost in musing, but as I stepped into that room with its stairs leading down, I pulled up short[, noticing something vital]. The flashlight was dimmer. My eyes had adjusted, but through my liquor-addled head I noticed the room was still less bright than the last time I'd been down here. \n\nNiko must have run down the batteries with all his exploring.\n\nThis didn't especially worry me: after our first trip I'd brought up this possibility. “Yeah, fuck that,” he'd said, and duct-taped four fresh batteries to the long body of the flashlight.\n\nBut it did occur to me---now---that to change them down here I'd have to do it in total darkness. Fiddling with sticky tape, fumbling to unscrew the light, pouring out the old batteries and not mixing them up with the new ones, by feel...\n\nSo there was that. \n\nI thought for a minute about going back. But I was close to the pool room now. I wanted to find out what was inside that fridge. What Niko had been keeping from me.\n\nAnd I did have the batteries, after all. If I needed to change them, it would just take a second. \n\nI kept going. \n\nThe last set of stairs down, with their weird irrational angles, passed quickly. The hall at the bottom stretched into the gloom, and I sped past the long stretch with no doors till I reached the pool room.\n\nThe door was closed. So Niko {i/had} been back here.\n\nInside was the smooth[,] curved concrete of the pool bottom. I grabbed for the lowest rung of the ladder and pulled myself up, a familiar motion from my swimming days [but weird to be doing it bone-dry, free of buoyancy|made unfamiliar through lack of buoyancy, being clothed and bone-dry]. \n\nThe upper level had a lip about three feet wide extending around the edge of the empty pool, and on the ladder side the space opened up, concrete giving way to linoleum. Sure enough, there was a full kitchen up there, just like Niko had described. With all the appliances, it was fairly cozy. I stared bemused at the chrome dials on the oven, the row of pale-green cabinets with round white handles. \n\nI turned to the fridge. It looked dated, a fading yellow with tacky chrome highlights. It only had one big door; no freezer. No magnets or family photos, either. Generically anonymous.\n\nI [pulled|tugged] at the handle, but it didn't budge. Studying it, I saw what Niko had been talking about: there was a small keyhole under the handle. Smaller than a house key: more like one for a padlock, something you'd put on a shed.\n\nThe keys I'd lifted from Niko looked about right.\n\nI picked one and slid it into the lock. It went in smooth, with a satisfying click as it bottomed out. But when I turned it, it wouldn't rotate.\n\nFrustrated, I jigged it back and forth, turning harder. The key was too small to get a solid grip on. I squeezed down and gave it a really good twist.\n\nFor a second I thought it was turning, but then I realized I'd bent the key. I'd come close to snapping it in half. \n\nI pulled it gingerly from the lock, staring at it in disappointment. Well, shit. There wouldn't be any hiding this from him now. It was bent nearly in half. I [@fridgetrapped>tossed it on the counter for a minute|slipped it into my back pocket] as I tried to think what to do.\n\nIn between the little noises I made, the taps and scratches and breaths, [the silence almost smothered me|I felt the silence like a weight on my shoulders, pressing me down].\n\n{i/Try the other key.}\n\nIt slid in easy too, and when I gently twisted this one, it turned. I rotated it through a full three sixty before I heard a second snick.\n\nI pulled at the fridge handle and the door swung open, cold air and yellow light wafting out.\n\nI wasn't sure what I expected to see ({i/frozen heads}, the part of my brain still traumatized by horror movies suggested) so it took a moment of blinking in confusion to realize the fridge was empty. There weren't even any shelves other than the one above the crisper drawers on the bottom, though the walls had notches where they should go. But no food. A butter dish and condiment nooks in the door, unused.\n\nThere was nothing in there.\n\nExcept---frowning, I bent down, shining the light inside. The fridge was {i/deep}. It went back a good six feet. And there was something on the back wall.\n\nThe inside of another fridge door. Condiment nooks. Another butter dish. \n\n{i/What the hell?}\n\nFeeling foolish, I clambered inside, flashlight bumping against the plastic floor above two pairs of crisper drawers, one facing in, one facing out. They held my weight. \n\nI shuffled forward, hunched over (there was less than five feet of vertical space) and pushed the inner door. No give. I pushed harder, remembering stories about kids stuck in fridges, but still nothing. {i/Is this one locked too?} I searched for a keyhole, but didn't see one. {i/Which makes sense, if it's on the outside.} I turned back to confirm[: yep, the|, and yes, the] door I'd come through had no sign of a lock on its inner surface.\n\nThe logo on the plastic butter compartment said Whirlpool. \n\nA thought popped into my head: {i/What if it's like an airlock?} This made no kind of logical sense, but seemed compelling. Only one door open at a time, otherwise you'd let all the cold air out. I almost giggled, then stopped myself, afraid.\n\n{i/What am I doing?}\n\nI decided to try it[. Why not? Nothing made sense, so maybe this would, for lack of any better ideas]. Turning awkwardly, I reached for the door I'd come through [@originalniko>with the hand holding the flashlight] to pull it shut. It wasn't designed to be pulled from the inside, but I [managed to get|got] a grip on a condiment shelf and swung it firmly towards me.\n\nAs the door slammed shut two things happened, both terrifying in different ways. First, there were two snicks, one from the door in front of me and one behind.\n\n# Way in Chapter 17, the originalniko path needs light to work inside the portals. So in this version we need to provide a different excuse for why the light goes out here.\nSecond, [@originalniko>I lost my grip on the flashlight, and it tumbled out of my hands, hit the hard shelf underneath me with a crack, and|my flashlight] went out.\n\nCold terror flushed through me. I [@originalniko>felt for the light, grabbed it and shook it|shook the light], pressed the button on and off. Nothing happened. I pushed the door in front of me but it didn't give at all. I slammed into it hard with my whole body, panicking, the rounded edge of a plastic shelf jabbing into my cheekbone, but the door didn't budge.\n\n{i/Because it's locked}, I told myself, mind whirling. {i/But the one behind you is open, now.} I twisted around, facing the back of the fridge as near I could tell, the second door.\n\nBut the thought of opening that door in pitch blackness, a door leading into complete unknown, opening it blind and crawling out into darkness, was terrifying. I stayed frozen, caught between fears: staying there or moving forward. Finally some combination of claustrophobia and visions of my air running out triumphed over my fear of the unknown[@originalniko>. Trying to keep my breathing calm, I unscrewed the end of the flashlight by feel, dumped out the old batteries, and one at a time replaced them with the fresh ones duct-taped to its sides. I held my breath and turned it on. {pp} Blessed light flooded the tiny chamber. {pp} Anxious to escape,|.] I crab-walked forward till my outstretched hand touched the other door. Before I could stop to think, I kept moving forward, pushing my weight against it.\n\nThe door opened easily[@originalniko>. | and my flashlight came back on.\n\n{i/Like the fridge light}, I thought, dizzy. {i/Goes out when the door is closed, comes back when you open it. Makes perfect sense.} I actually laughed out loud and then stopped myself.\n\nI couldn't laugh. I had to take this seriously, while I was down here. Or I might never get out.\n\n]Stumbling on cramped knees, I spilled out of the fridge and staggered upright, shining my light around warily. But what I saw confused me even more.\n\nIt was the same room. \n\nI frowned, mind working, flashing the light over every surface like a brush that might paint sense into what I was seeing.\n\nIt was the same kitchen---same ovens, same green cabinets, same improbably-adjacent concrete pool. Not a mirror image, or a slightly different design: it was the same room I'd just left. [The only difference was|Except now] the fridge was on the opposite wall. \n\nLike it had connected through the wall to an identical room on the other side.\n\nDizzy. \n\nI took a few steps forward, shined the light over the edge of the pool. Same ladder, same door, although it was shut. Had I shut it behind me this time? I'd been in a hurry. I couldn't remember.\n\nI turned back to the fridge, and froze. \n\nThe door had swung shut behind me.\n\nI pulled on the handle, but it didn't budge. Locked.\n\nShit. Where was the key? [@fridgetrapped>I checked my pockets. It wasn't on me. What had I done with it?\n\nA sinking feeling crept over me. {i/It was still in the lock on the other side.}\n\nAnd I'd set the other one, the bent one, on the counter before coming through.\n\nMaybe that was the one that fit this side?\n\nI stood there for a long moment, not sure of what to do. \n\nI grabbed the handle again and pulled it harder, as hard as I could; tried to pull the whole fridge forward. But its back end was flush with the wall, and it didn’t budge even a little, like it was cemented in place.\n\nThere was nowhere else to go. The fridge was locked, and the only door out was at the bottom of the pool.\n\nResigned, |I'd left it in the lock on the other side. But the other one, the one I'd bent, the one that didn't fit, was still in my pocket.\n\nI pulled it out again to frown at it, knowing somehow what would happen before I tried it. Sure enough, when I slipped the bent key into the lock and turned it, this time it rotated easily and the door swung open.\n\nDifferent key. Different lock. {i/Different door.}\n\nDifferent room.\n\nI shut and locked it again, shaking my head.\n\nI had to see.] I climbed down the ladder, dropped onto the concrete. I opened the door onto the doorless hallway.\n\nA wave of déjà vu hit me as I looked down it. It was the same hall I'd passed through minutes before---but I knew it couldn't be. I'd crawled out the other side of the fridge. This wasn't the same place, and yet it had that ineffable tang of familiar places, the twinge that tells you {i/I've been here before}.\n\nAs I walked down the hallway, I looked for some distinguishing feature to confirm this intuition: but the decor was, as always, so bland that nothing stood out. It could have been any basement hallway anywhere.\n\nWhen I hit the stairs back up to the [@octagon>eight-sided|@hexagon>six-sided|@pentagon>five-sided] room, though, something went wrong.\n\nI'd stopped without meaning to, clutching the banister, foot on the first step. I looked up the stairs, and a faint twinge of vertigo brushed me. [@alcohol>Or not vertigo, exactly. It's hard to describe.|It was like what I'd felt that first night we came Downstairs, when I thought I'd seen something at the end of the hall.] It wasn't quite premonition, a sensation, a tingling, an insight. It wasn't like knowing or feeling at all.\n\nSomething inside me between [reason and emotion|reason and intuition|emotion and intuition|emotion and reason|intuition and emotion|intuition and reason] just didn't want to go back up there.\n\n[Like that sense you get before eating spoiled food, even if you haven't consciously smelled anything sour. Like this is going to be bad for you.\n\nLike you're going to regret it.]\n\n[@dadphone>I had a sudden vivid flashback to a photo I’d seen as a kid, still confused about my burgeoning sexuality. It was from an article in a news magazine about gay bashing: there’d been an upswing of murders everywhere, big cities and small towns. The photo showed a chalk outline on a dirty sidewalk and next to it a spray-painted message, red and messy: “A Queer Died Here.” I remember a wave of despair and horror washing over me as I stared at that picture, curdling the pulse-pounding fear of getting caught I always had when encountering something relating to my secret suspicions about myself. That was the first time I understood it wouldn’t just be embarrassing or awkward to be gay, or found out as gay. There were people who would hate me for it, maybe even kill me. That was how wrong they thought I was.|@bradphone>When Bradley had outed us both in high school the aftermath had been ugly, in more ways than one. My house started getting egged once or twice a week. Sometimes it was worse than eggs. One day I came home from school and someone had drawn a red chalk outline on our driveway, like at a murder scene. Next to it they'd written {i/your next queer}. I got the hose and a brush and scrubbed it out fast, wanting it gone before mom got home from work, because she'd already moved me to a new school and I was afraid if she saw the chalk outline, the message, she'd move us to a whole new state, have to quit her job and leave behind her friends and my sister's too, both of them giving up everything because of me, and I couldn't stand the thought of that. I think that was the first time I really understood that some people weren't just grossed out by gay people, or morally offended. They wanted us dead. That was how wrong they thought we were.]\nTo know just existing could make people feel that way about you, to realize that this was the world you’d have to live in, to keep growing up in. If you could.\n\nThe creeping feeling I felt now was like that. An existential wrongness. And it was getting stronger. Like a light from around a distant corner, growing brighter.\n\nI listened, motionless, but heard nothing. The quiet pressed [against] me.\n\n{i/What am I going to do? Go back?}\n\nNo. \n\nTaking a deep breath, I made an impulsive decision. A few paces back was a door, and without stopping to think I pulled it open. [@furnished>^The room inside was crammed with furniture under sheets. On a normal day this might have scared the piss out of me, but this feeling of wrongness was getting so strong|The room inside was dark and empty, except for another doorless closet at the far end. It was a terrible place to hide but] I would have run straight into a room full of [grinning clowns|oversized spiders|laughing skulls] rather than stay in that hallway any longer.\n\nI slipped in and shut the door behind me, quietly---that felt important---and ran to the far end of the room[@furnished>^. Spotting something sofa-shaped, I lifted the edge of the sheet that covered it and half-crawled, half-dived inside. Flipping onto my back, I smoothed the sheet,|, half-blind without the light from the hall. Carefully, I wedged myself into the closet. I couldn't hide myself entirely: my feet would stick out and be visible from the door. But it was better than nothing. I] held my hand over the flashlight---I couldn't bear to turn it off---and held my breath.\n\nThe feeling had diminished when I ran across the room, but now was growing again. I was trembling. I tried not to breathe, to relax my face as if doing so would open my ears wider, let me hear fainter sounds. \n\nIt was deathly quiet. All I could hear was my heartbeat.\n\nThe top of my hand glowed a dull red as the flashlight beam lit up bones and the dark veins between them.\n\nThe feeling reached an unbearable crescendo, and held there sustained. I was shivering and couldn't stop. It was [a] wrongness, wrongness on every level, filling [up my body|me up]. I wanted it to go away more than anything. \n\n[@furnished>^I thought I heard something move in the hallway outside. Scuffing the carpet, maybe.|I leaned forward---slow, careful, heart racing---enough to peek around the edge of the closet. To see the door.\n\nThe light spilling in from the crack underneath was dimmed in the middle.\n\nLike someone was standing there.\n\nI pulled my head back, trembling. Tried not to breathe. Tried, with every atom of my being, to listen.]\n\nThen, mercifully, the feeling started to drain away.\n\nI let out a breath, then took in another. With each one I felt more in balance, an equilibrium I'd never thought to appreciate until now. In another minute, all that was left was me: coated in sweat, crashing off adrenaline, but all right.\n\nAnd yeah, it took fifteen minutes to muster the courage to [@furnished>^lift the sheet and walk back across that room. Now that my regular instincts were back, the thought of what might be under all those other sheets|walk back across that dark room to the door, even with my flashlight. Now that my regular instincts were back, the dark] was fucking terrifying.\n\n{section_break}\n\nWhen I'd recovered, I hurried across the room, out into the hall, and back up the stairs. My brain had gone numb: I let myself feel like I was retracing my steps, but another part of me knew I moved through different halls and rooms, on the wrong side of the fridge. But going back would mean following the direction that ugly feeling had drifted---and I couldn't do that. So I climbed the stairs to the {room shape name} room, through the identical hallways back, and up the second stairs to the lighted upper levels, everything exactly as it should have been.\n\nWhen I saw the coffee stain, though, I stopped. \n\nIt was right where Niko had spilled it on our first trip down, where the coffee had sloshed as he'd forced open the sticky door.\n\nIt was the same hallway. But I couldn't explain how.\n\nWhat had happened? My brain whirred, trying to manufacture sense. \n\nWhat I finally decided was this: I must have gotten turned around in the dark fridge. Banging the inside of the door, trying to force it open, I somehow moved the fridge, pushed it across the kitchen to the opposite wall. When I came out, it was through the other door, but into the same room. [@fridgetunnel>And I must have gotten confused about the keys: maybe I hadn't turned the first one the right way when I tried it, that was all.]\n\n[@fridgetrapped>It worked if I didn't think about it too hard.\n\n{i/But then where was the key?}\n\nSimple. Still in the lock, but on the side now up against the wall. As for the key on the counter, maybe I'd knocked it off with all my banging in the fridge. It fell on the floor, got kicked away or maybe swept underneath.]\n\nI couldn't honestly convince myself of this.\n\n{i/It's the same coffee stain.}\n\nI felt superimposed. It had to be the same hallway, and yet it had to be a different one. This was the same stain, and yet I was a ten-minute walk from where Niko had spilled his coffee.\n\n[Maybe going Downstairs drunk had been a bad idea.]\n\nI kept going. I made it back to the big room, looking just as I'd left it, and climbed the final stairs gingerly. But my room was waiting for me at the top, nothing out of place: my records, my textbooks, my dirty laundry. That settled that. Somehow, I'd come back the same way I went in. But I felt deflated, unresolved, like the last fifty pages of the book had been left out. {i/And then he: The End.}\n\nI shut the bed behind me more firmly than necessary. I considered nailing it shut but settled for piling some heavy boxes on top of it.\n\nIt had been maybe an hour since I'd left. Niko was still passed out on the couch in our front room.\n\nI curled up on the next couch over and, despite being so keyed up I could barely think, dropped into sleep.\n\n{section_break}\n\nI woke some time later to [Niko|him] shaking my shoulder, and sat up, bleary-eyed. It was still dark outside.\n\n“Go to bed,” he was saying, “it's late.”\n\nI yawned. The trip Downstairs seemed like a dream, coming back in bits and pieces. I snuck a glance at the corner of the table where he'd emptied his pockets, but his stuff was gone. Did he notice I'd taken the keys?\n\nShit. I'd have to tell him.\n\n“Hey man,” I said, dreading this. “You remember earlier when you pulled your shit out to get your phone, and left it on the table?”\n\nHe blinked. “Um. No.”\n\nHe'd been pretty drunk. I pressed on. “We were about halfway through finishing that bottle.” The vodka bottle was about a quarter full. I frowned. Hadn't we killed it?\n\nShaking my head, I pressed on. “Look. What I'm trying to say is, I took the keys. I'm sorry. I just wanted to know if you'd found something down there. Why you hadn't told me. I went but there was nothing there, and I got turned around and... anyway, it doesn't matter. I screwed up and I lost [@fridgetrapped>them both. Both keys.|one key, and uh, kind of damaged the other.]” It sounded so stupid as I said it, and I hated myself, both for stealing from him and for [@fridgetrapped>squandering whatever opportunity they'd represented|failing to discover anything useful with them]. “I'm an idiot, man, and I'm sorry. But look, if you tell me where you found them, maybe we could figure something out, and talk about what's going on, and everything?”\n\nNiko was frowning, but didn't seem angry. Maybe this wasn't going to be a big deal after all.\n\nHe sat down on the floor next to me, a serious look on his face.\n\n“Orion,” he said, “exactly what fucking keys are you talking about?”\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And as I tried to piece together the evening, to backtrace what had happened, little details kept failing to add up. The vodka bottle. The [@movieline>movie quote|@songlyric>lyrics]: now he agreed with me, was baffled that I thought he could possibly get [@movieline>it|them] wrong. He pulled out his phone and showed me the last text from his ex: four months ago.\n\nDespite these discrepancies, something felt right about the way we discussed them. We were back in sync again. The strained awkwardness and stunted conversations of the [last|past] week were gone. It felt like he'd been away on a trip and we were catching up again, despite the fact that we'd been seeing each other all week.\n\nBut when I told him where I'd been that night, about the fridge and the keys, it was like I'd punched him in the face.\n\nHe bolted up, took a few paces, then collapsed into a chair, stricken. “Oh, shit,” he kept saying. “Oh shit oh shit oh shit.”\n\nHe wouldn't say anything else until I poured him another shot of vodka---the vodka we'd already finished, goddammit---and then the story started breaking out of him in [sharp-edged|dangerous] pieces.\n\n“[Remember the night of the party?|Okay, so. The night of the party.]” He looked drained. “I didn't feel like talking, you know, to other humans. So I went exploring. Had a vague thought like maybe I'd find something interesting to bring back up and show you.” He ran a shaky hand through his kinked hair. “But something...” He swallowed. “Something happened, okay? And I got to the pool room and I couldn't go back the same way.” He waved a hand at my raised eyebrow. “Let me just finish telling this, okay?”\n\nHe wouldn't say what had happened, but it made him change course, and [after wandering through unfamiliar halls for a few minutes|eventually] he found himself approaching the pool room door from the other direction. He climbed the ladder into the kitchen, but when he got there found the fridge not only unlocked, but open---the outer door, at least. He'd done the same thing I had: climbed inside, pulled the door shut, lost his light, pushed the other door open---and climbed out with the same spatial confusion I'd had.\n\nI told him my theory about knocking the fridge around, but he shook his head. “No, I don't think so. When my light went out, I was pretty deliberate with my motions, exactly because I didn't want to get turned around. I barely jostled the thing. And there's something else that makes me think...”\n\nHe swallowed, licked his lips. For a long minute, he couldn't meet my eye. Then he grabbed my knee, as if to steady himself, looked over at me. Looked hard. “Ryan. Man. This is going to sound crazy. But listen, okay? This place. This house.” He looked around furtively, as if we were someplace dangerous and not the living room of our college crash pad. [As if it could hear us.] “We're not where we used to be. {i/This is a different place.}”\n\n“[Step off|Hang on|Wait a minute],” I said, rejecting this at once. “It's one thing to say there's a couple mirrored hallways down there, but there's not a whole different house up here. There aren't clones of our goddamn roommates, a different street and sky and...”\n\nI trailed off, because he was staring at me, miserable. I realized this was exactly what he thought was happening.\n\n“Look,” I said, worried and afraid, “let's go back right now. I'll show you the coffee stain. That proves it.[@fridgetrapped> We can find the other key and---]”\n\n“I'm not going back down there.” He pulled back. “I've been too damn terrified to even think about it, after what I…” He bit his lip, looked away. Took the last swig of vodka.\n\nTingles crawled down my neck. “What you saw? Well, what was it?”\n\nHe didn't answer for a while. I thought he was trying to remember at first, and then maybe that he was trying to forget.\n\nFinally, defeated, he told me. “On my way down. Before I got there. I started feeling... off. Like something was wrong.”\n\n[66>“That happened to me, too. I hid in a side room and waited, and after a while it went away.”\n\n“Yeah,” he said weakly, “probably what I should have done. You know me, man. I ignored it. I kept going. And...”]\n\nHe stopped, trembling. Phantom insects crawled up my back. What did he see to rattle him this bad?\n\n“That long hallway. Without any doors. I was walking down it, and I saw another light.”\n\nI sat rigid. “What the fuck?”\n\n“I kept walking,” he went on, not looking at me. “I didn't want to turn my back, get chased down. That sick feeling got stronger. Sharper. But I couldn't stop walking. Couldn't turn around.”\n\nHe took a deep breath. “The light got closer. It was someone with a flashlight. They were walking toward me the same way I was walking toward them. I couldn't see their face. I just kept walking. I kind of hugged the right wall and they hugged the left. The flashlight was right in my face. I couldn't see anything until we were only a few steps apart.”\n\nHe met my gaze at last, forehead wet with cold sweat, like he was reliving that queasy sensation. My own stomach twisted. I couldn't breathe.\n\n“Ry,” he said, “I passed myself. I walked right past another me with another flashlight, who looked as sick and fucked up as I did. And we both kept walking. We didn't stop. I made it to the pool room, climbed the ladder, and went right through that fucking fridge to get farther away. And there is no fucking way I'm going back down there again.”\n\nI swallowed. “Dude. It was dark. You were messed up. Maybe you saw someone else down there, but what you're saying, man. It's impossible.”\n\n“Irrational.” A hollow laugh. “Things are different here. [On this side.] I'll show you. What's the smallest bill you've got in your wallet?”\n\n“Uh, I don't know.” Taken aback, I pulled it out, riffled through the smaller bills. He smiled grimly at one of them, snatched it, held it up. \n\n“Better hold onto this. Because no one here's ever heard of one.”\n\n“What are you talking about?” I said, annoyed.\n\nAnd over the next hour, he showed me.\n\nWe pored through the dusty encyclopedia in our front foyer. We combed the magazines sitting in the house, dragged out Monopoly. We fired up the Internet (all GeoCities and tedium in those days) and found pictures of cash registers, government websites, coin collectors talking about the history of currency.\n\nAccording to everything we could find, the US Government had never, at any point in its history, issued a three dollar bill as legal tender. \n\nWe stared at the one from my wallet with growing unease. Buchanan's familiar portrait stared back, implacable. Niko tapped the portrait's chin. “That right there might be the only one that exists in this place. Wherever we are.”\n\n{section_break}\n\nWe cobbled together a theory out of guesswork and dreams.\n\nIf Downstairs had two sides---two versions, or halves, or whatever---then Niko had passed into the other one the night of the party, through the unlocked fridge. The Niko I saw stumbling out of the hall that night, sick and wanting sleep, was the wrong Niko. A different Niko. The one my Niko had passed in the hall.\n\nAnd that Niko didn't quite fit in. Everything was a little off about him, and from his perspective, I suppose, about me. \n\nBut that Niko had found two keys. We had no idea where he'd found them. But if he'd passed through the fridge with one of them---and here I will compress the part where we opened another bottle of vodka rather than accept the ridiculousness of this garbage fairy tale premise where a magical Frigidaire is a gateway between worlds, slept it off, suffered through ugly hangovers the next day, and reconvened late in the afternoon with some Aspirin---if the other Niko came through the fridge just before my Niko had, that could explain why my Niko had found it unlocked and open, was able to pass through.\n\nAnd earlier---if we followed this chain of logic---I'd been drinking from a different vodka bottle, in a different house, with that other Niko. The one with the keys.\n\nI'd stolen them and passed through to this side of Downstairs---the wrong side---and maybe some other me had been doing the same thing. I only avoided him by my sudden detour, when I sensed something wrong up ahead and ducked into the side room[@furnished>^ with the sheet-covered furniture], to let him pass by. And now we were both in the wrong house, on the opposite side from where we'd started.\n\n“And both of them are on the wrong side, too,” Niko said, still wincing from the hangover. \n\nI licked my lips, head also still spinning, wondering if it would be okay to take two more Aspirin. Or four more. “But these other two, if they exist.” I still couldn't quite surrender to this madness. [@fridgetrapped>“The other two now have both keys, right?”\n\nNiko frowned. “What do you mean?”\n\n“I left one in the fridge on the other side---our original side---when I went down last night. And the other, the bent one, on the counter. Also on that side. They're both on that side.”\n\nHis face soured. “And the door locked behind you. So there's no way for us to get back.”|“They could come back any time they wanted, right? And so could we.”\n\n“Because the key's still in the lock on their side.” Niko frowned. “And you've got the one for this side. Both keys are back where they should be now. One for us and one for them.”]\n\n“Unless there are two keys [@fridgetrapped>on|for] this side too.”\n\n“No. You said the first one you tried didn't work, even though it looked the same? I think there's exactly two keys. One for each side. The other me ended up with both, somehow. I guess if he found one and went through, he’d know right where to look for the second.” [@fridgetrapped>He took a breath, let it out. “So yeah, you're right. They've got both keys. Unless they come back through, we're stuck here.”]\n\nWe stared at each other.\n\n“What does that mean?” I asked.\n\n“I have no fucking idea. But shit, man, I'm glad you're here.” He ran a hand through his curls, face pale. “I seriously wasn't handling this on my own. This whole last week, things weren't right. {i/You} weren't right, and I couldn't stand that, man. I was going crazy without you. Doubting everything, you know how I get. Doubting who I even was. But this, this is...” He waved his hand back and forth between the two of us, then knocked it on the table. “You get me. We're tight. Yeah? In it together, I mean. It's good. I'm glad.”\n\nI didn't say anything, but I didn't have to. I felt the same way and he knew it.\n\nI slept in his room that night, in a sleeping bag beside his bed. He didn't want to be alone. I'd kind of wanted some time to process everything but I didn't protest too much. I liked being his anchor. He kept us both up late talking about random bullshit, rambling. It was okay. Everything was upside down. Old comforts couldn't hurt.\n\n{section_break}\n\nWe slept in the next day. Call me a coward, but buried in my sleeping bag I could pretend I wasn't in the wrong universe.\n\nThings were definitely wrong. Now that I was looking, I couldn't deny it. Familiar people acted strange in a way you couldn't put your finger on. Colors seemed indefinably different shades. A vague sense of off-ness suffused everything, like a movie with the sound a frame out of sync.\n\nAfter looking more closely, things were off about my room. There was an unfamiliar dress shirt on a hanger. My copy of {FavAuthor}'s {FavBook}  was missing, along with all the other books of {FavAuthorHisHers} I'd discovered after reading that one. [@cdrom>The weird CD-ROM game I'd been playing was gone from my desk and my hard drive: now internet searches for it came back with nothing at all.] It wasn't quite my room, I realized. It was someone else's.\n\nIt was mostly little things, so we grasped at each quantitative difference, each change we could pin down. One night one of our housemates kept saying something I didn't understand. She was going on about getting a parking ticket and kept saying it was the “fourth fucking time” it had happened.\n\n“What's that word you're saying?”\n\n“Fucking,” she clarified, unhelpfully.\n\n“No,” I said. “Count up in ordinals. You know, first, second...”\n\nShe blinked at me. “First, second, third, fourth, fifth.”\n\nFourth. Instead of fourd.\n\nThings were different here.\n\nWe didn't find too many obvious changes.

But it didn't really satisfy. Why these two universes in particular, out of a supposedly infinite number? Why were they connected via a series of poorly decorated basement rooms and linked together by a refrigerator, of all things?\n\nAt one point, feeling overwhelmed, I called home---not to tell mom what was happening because I didn't want her to freak, just to hear her voice---but the answering machine said they were on vacation till the end of the month. This was annoying both because I hadn't heard about any long vacation, and because “we” presumably meant her and my sister, and for some reason I hadn't been invited, which made me feel even more out of place and abandoned. I was three hours away, not on a different planet. \n\nFeeling rejected, I went record shopping, adding a couple hundred dollars to my already terrifying credit card debt in exchange for a small stack of LPs. Lately I'd gotten obsessed with sci-fi audio book recordings. I found a few treasures at my usual haunts: Leonard Nimoy reading Ray Bradbury, and a six-record set of one of the Dune novels, read by Frank Herbert himself, still shrink-wrapped. More and more I only bought stuff in its original wrapping, unopened, sleeves protected from scuffs and wear marks, the records inside unplayed and undamaged, which is how I'd keep them.\n\n[MACRO to hell and back][90>to hell and back|10>from heck to breakfast]\n[@dadphone>Dad was the one who got me into records, back when I was still a kid and he was the most amazing person in the world. He took me to Disneyland, just the two of us (I don’t remember now why mom and my sister weren’t there), and we stayed late to see the Main Street Electrical Parade, and on our way out, way past my bedtime, he got me the record, my first record. I have eight different versions of that album now, six still in their original shrink-wrap. That first one I played so much it got scratched beyond belief, had to be constantly nudged forward out of stuck grooves, the cardboard sleeve beat {to hell and back}. I've still got that one, too.\n\nI’d idolized dad. He’d worked for the Department of Agriculture, which doesn’t sound that glamorous but was legendary in my mind: my understanding of his job was that he traveled around the country helping farmers grow food better, the food that everyone in the country ate, and to me that was as noble and heroic as being an astronaut. Because of his job we had to move every couple years, and so I never really had any long-term friends. Except him. My sister and I were never that close---even as kids, our interests were too different---but dad and I, we understood each other. We were always there for each other.\n\nMaybe it was because of what happened with dad that I got so needy with my friendships later on, desperate to hold on to them. I either wanted to be your best friend in the world or not interact with you at all. That wasn't a recipe for a healthy social life in high school. I had a few friendships, here and there, but they didn't last: I'd cling too hard and people would drift away. Niko, I guess, was the first one who ever clung back.\n\nThank god I had him back again.\n\n|@bradphone>Bradley had been the one who got me into records. I was a cassette tape kid and a Discman high schooler, but he'd hooked me on the sound of LPs, the joys of flipping through those big bold album covers in record stores; of lying on your back blissing out to the singular magic of some rare recording or old favorite spun roaring back to life, twenty-two minutes at a time. \n\nAfter what happened in the cafeteria I didn't talk to him for a long time. He kept trying to see me. Calling the house, throwing pebbles at my window late at night. I ignored it all. I was so angry at him, for taking something from me I couldn't quite encircle or define: more than  my coming out, but all the changes inside me that would have led up to it, too. For putting me in danger, and my friends, my family.\n\nHe didn't give up. He left long, rambling messages on our answering machine, slipped love letters under the door. He was waiting outside the house one day when I walked home from my new school and there on the front porch, wearing our backpacks, I told him I didn't want to see him any more and broke his heart.\n\nHe begged me. He pleaded. He screamed and then apologized for screaming; he groveled, he cried. He told me he couldn't live without me. He said I'd never find anyone who'd love me like he did. He said if I threw away what we had because of the bigots and bullies I'd be letting them win. \n\nWhen my little sister got home he started begging and pleading with her to talk some sense into me, and when he grabbed her arm and started shouting at her too, that's when I hit him.\n\nHe kept calling and writing and dropping by the house until my mom got the police involved. After that I never saw him again.  \n\nProbably it was because of what happened with Bradley that I got so guarded with my friendships later on. I kept a polite distance from most people, and almost everyone I met in college stayed an acquaintance, not a friend. It was as if I'd lost the knack of getting close to people, of letting them in. Connecting. Niko broke through that, somehow, became the first close friend I'd had in years, and even though I tried not to cling too hard, eventually I figured out why it had been so difficult not to. He'd been clinging back.\n\n]\nWe stayed close, maybe inevitably now that we were the only matching pair in this entire universe. It felt easy to be closer to him, for us both to need each other. It felt right. A relief from the wrongness all around us.\n\nHe thought my airlock idea had legs. Downstairs was made from house-stuff: hallways and empty rooms and appliances. A fridge was one of the few devices in that context that could maintain a seal. It was a cute concept except it didn't actually explain anything.\n\nIt took a long time to convince him we needed to go back down.\n\n“Maybe we can just stay here, and they can stay there,” he said. “So everything's off a little. So what? It felt way more wrong to get close to...” He waved a hand. “Him. Whoever. My handsome twin. So maybe we should leave well enough alone. Brick the fucker up and never look back.”\n\nThen the headaches started.\n\nThey were odd headaches. Not severe. A tinge of nausea and dizziness, like stepping off one of those fairground rides that whirls you around[@singular04>; a smell like purple freesia, warm and clean but with dangerous undertones of promises unkept, sacrifices yet to be made;|,] and only a very distant pain. They came and went. But I took them as an ominous sign.\n\nNiko said he'd been getting them all week. Oh. And they'd been getting stronger.\n\nSo the headaches more than anything convinced us. We had to go back down, [@fridgetrapped>at least try to figure out what was going on, or at least how we could get back. Maybe the fridge wasn't the only connection. Maybe there were other keys, other doors.|try to get back through. Or maybe there were other points of connection.] We'd barely started exploring. There was so much left.\n\nBut first we had to solve what Niko called the Mere Paradox. He threw a spoon at me when I said this back to him.\n\n“No, smart-ass. A {i/Mirror} Paradox. We're obviously in this creepy weird sync with them.” We were in his room with the door shut, and he was pacing the two-and-a-half steps of cleared floor while I lay on his bed, thinking. “Example. Me and the other Niko both went exploring on the same night. The other side, the other house, they were having a party that night too. We both saw that. The decor, uh, such as it was, was the same on both sides, or close enough. He and I were so synced up that we got to the fridge only minutes apart. He beat me, so he came through first, and then we passed in the hall.” He stopped pacing, shuddered, and drummed his fingers on a bulky MIDI keyboard propped up against a wall gathering dust. “Two. A week later, both pairs of us end up getting drunk off vodka on the same night. Oh, there's these little differences---one side finishes the bottle, the other doesn't, and this me didn't get a certain text message that night---but both versions of you decide to go exploring. Again, you get to the pool room only minutes apart.  For the most part it's like we're staying in a kind of lockstep, despite the superficial differences.” \n\n“Your conclusion, professor.”\n\n“If we go down to explore, they will too. We meet in the middle, and bam.” He shook his head. “Exactly what we don't want to happen.” He saw I was still confused, so he scribbled two arrows on his whiteboard, pointed right at each other. “The fridge is the connection point. The only way each pair of us can get back, so far as we know. But if we go back there, so will they. It's like we're trapped on two sides of a mirror. We each want to touch it, but we can't do it at the same time.”\n\n“Would it really be so bad?”\n\nHe glared down at me. “You don't trust that feeling? I got a lot closer than you, and man, it was the worst. I don't know what was causing it or why, but every part of my body was screaming something was wrong, was sick, was going to harm me.” He sighed and flopped down next to me. “So [^meeting ourselves is out. No choosing between having to fuck or fight yourself.”\n\n“Which would you do?”\n\n“I would definitely fuck myself,” he said, solemn. “You?”\n\nI wrinkled my nose. “Ugh. Neither. I think both of us would take one look at each other and back away in mortified embarrassment.”\n\n“Sounds about right. So] if we can’t get close to each other, but trying to cross through will bring us together, then what do we do?”\n\n“Okay, so we explore at random.” I sat up. “Every branch, we roll dice. Even if the others are in sync and pick the same time to explore, they'll go down different paths.”\n\nHe shook his head. “I think the lockstep runs deeper than that. Even randomness could be part of it. The coffee stain. Remember? We both passed the one on this side, coming out. That's what made you assume you were in the same place. Because it was identical, right? If both versions of me spilled coffee and both made exactly the same stain, I bet dice would fall the same way too.”\n\n“How do we know it's identical? Did you really stop and look that close?”\n\nThat got him. Niko would jump off a bridge to win an argument. A few minutes later we were headed back down the stairs, keeping up a forced light banter. It helped that the coffee stain was close to the surface, and far enough away from the fridge that even if the others went down at the same time, to look at their stain, we'd be nowhere near each other.\n\nNo one had cleaned up after the party---in fact, the other housemates had stopped coming down here at all, inexplicably---so there were still Christmas lights and red plastic cups strewn around the big room. Weirdly comforting. We retraced our first trip through the upper hallways to the coffee stain, and got down on hands and knees to study it. I immediately felt foolish.\n\n“This won't prove anything. We never looked at the original this close.” I shrugged. “I don't know. It looks the same to me.”\n\n“But exactly the same?” Niko bent closer, excited. “No, I don't think so. I don't remember this trail of droplets off to the side here. Do you?”\n\nWe argued about it for a few minutes, but it was like grabbing soap in a bathtub. I'd read enough textbooks about memory and perception to know neither of us could accurately recall specifics of the other stain---it was weeks since we'd seen it and the details hadn't seemed important at the time.\n\nI got up, shaking my head. “What is this even meant to prove? Does it matter if they're identical or not?”\n\n“It matters,” he said emphatically, “because if it's exactly the same then the two sides are in total lockstep. We can't do anything different from them and they can't do anything different from us. But if the stains are different---even just a little---then there's a chance to break out of the pattern. Do something unique. That could be huge.”\n\n“But we know we're not exactly in sync,” I said. “For one thing, they somehow found keys down here. We never did that. [@fridgetrapped>And now they've got them both, and we don't have any. We'd be factoring them into our plans if we had them, right? So they must be doing that right now. Shit, man, they could come through the fridge if they wanted to, any time they want.” We both stopped at this, momentarily chilled.\n\n“So why haven’t they?” he said. “I mean, if we want to get back to the right side, they must too. Why haven't they come through and given one key back to us?”\n\n“Maybe they know something we don't,” I said, tired. “Like where they found them in the first place.”|They know things we don't, which means they're factoring that knowledge into their plans right now.”\n\n“Like where they found them in the first place,” he said, rubbing his temples. “Right.”]\n\nWe sat in the hall for a minute in glum silence. I stared at the coffee stain, like it was an inkblot that would resolve into something sensible if I could make my mind work the right way.\n\n“There's other differences,” I said. “When I went down, I felt like something was wrong, and I went and hid like a baby. The other version of me didn't do that. We did different things.”\n\n“Yeah,” he said, closing his eyes. “I'm actually worried about that.”\n\n“You were just saying you wanted us to be unique.”\n\nHe rubbed his forehead. Maybe he was getting another headache. “The two sides are nearly identical, as far as we can tell. The two versions of us are nearly identical too. So far, at least. But I don't know. Maybe if we start acting different, if we diverge too far...”\n\n“What?”\n\nHe shrugged. “Don't know. Just a thought. Probably garbage, never mind.”\n\nI closed my eyes and leaned my head back against the wall. [“I'm late for work.”\n\n“Gotta make rent,” he muttered. “Wouldn't want to get evicted now.”\n]\n\n{section_break}\n\nNiko was scared. He stayed close to me almost all the time, hanging out in my room, by the TV, wherever I was. This was a familiar pattern, actually: whenever he got overwhelmed he made me his full-time validator, babbling his interior monologue, running every decision big and small by me, ending most sentences with “Right?” or “Yeah?” It was like outsourcing his ego. I let him do it, like I always did[^, because it felt good to have him need me that much]. But I felt guilty, too, because it couldn’t be healthy.\n\n[At least it kept his mood from worsening. At low ebbs he'd slow down, stop moving: his face would go slack like the strings holding it up had been cut. He'd been known to lock himself in his room and not come out for days, at least not when anyone could see: not eating, not sleeping or maybe doing nothing but. He'd stop talking even to me. I'd bring him food and after knocking and joking and cajoling would have to leave it outside his door. The next afternoon it would still be there, crawling with flies, untouched. Eventually he'd emerge grinning like a cold-blooded reptile hit by a sunbeam; he'd shower and do laundry and throw out empty liquor bottles and clean up the dirty dishes and pretend like nothing had happened. But he knew he couldn't fool me.\n\nSo I kept him talking,|^We kept talking,]\nand our half-assed theories began to crystallize into a plan.\n\nWe rounded up a bunch of dice, some tarot and playing cards, loose change, a dreidel, and a stack of books, and devised a procedure---a ridiculously complicated procedure lasting almost an hour---to end up with two numbers, after several dozen iterations: the first between one and twenty-four, and the second between one and sixty. An hour, and a minute. The theory was that even if both sides were so close even randomness tended to turn out the same, if we stacked that randomness on top of itself, compounding chance on chance, it might be a wedge to split that sameness apart. Niko showed me a tiny video on his computer about strange attractors, said this was chaos theory in action, the butterfly effect. Whatever. We were making wild guesses.\n\nBut the hope was that even if the other versions of us were doing the exact same thing---following an identical procedure---their numbers would drift apart and they'd end up generating a completely different time.\n\n[@fridgetrapped>Which would allow us to leave something for each other at a rendezvous point.\n\n“The fridge is the natural spot,” he said, “Right in the middle. Maybe they'll give us back our key. Or leave a note with a better plan.”\n\nWe weren't sure what we could offer in return. Eventually we decided on a message. I had a carbon paper memo pad from my dad's old office: kind of a memento, but I wasn't feeling nostalgic. We could leave a handwritten note and keep a copy.|Which would allow each pair of us to pass through without crossing paths.]\n\nSo we had a plan. We just needed a time[@fridgetrapped>, and something to say].\n\n{section_break}\n\n“In hindsight,” Niko said, throwing back the last of the coffee and smacking his lips, “maybe we should have put a range on the fucking numbers. Dear god. I have [to be at work|a midterm] in five hours.”\n\nIt was just after three in the morning, and we were prepping to go down. The time we'd generated was 3:41. We hoped for their sake the guys on the other side got something more reasonable.\n\nNiko was in a rough mood, and it wasn't just the time of day. His old jock friends had been ragging him about not hanging out. (“I have to pretend sports bloopers are funny, Ry. It's horrible.”) Later he'd gotten a call from one or both of his parents about how his degree was progressing, which had not gone well. He spent the rest of the day in his room with the door shut blaring loud music and, apparently, watching a {i/Friends} marathon. Every time I listened at his door I kept hearing Joey say “How {i/you} doin'?” Laugh track. Maybe he was just watching the same episode on repeat. Late that night I knocked again and reminded him we had a three a.m. date. A long and mournful stream of cuss words came muffled through the door. After an ominous silence he opened it, looking bleak. “Whose stupid idea was this again?” he asked, then grimly set his alarm.\n\nWe'd planned a quick trip in and out, to minimize the chance of overlapping times. [@fridgetrapped>When we got to the kitchen, we'd leave the note in front of the fridge (since we couldn't open it ourselves) and immediately head back. If their time was earlier than ours, their message would be there waiting, maybe with the key if they were feeling generous; if not, we'd come back the next day at some convenient time to check again.|Once we passed through and got back up to the surface, our surface, we'd leave the house and stay away until the next day. The campus library stayed open all night and if you had a book in your lap they wouldn't usually hassle you for sleeping. The next morning, we'd come back home, the headaches would be gone, and everything would be back to normal.] It made sense, except we were making it all up and had no idea if any of this would work or if we were playing make-believe.\n\nSwinging up the bed did feel ominous now, though. I noticed for the first time that it creaked. Stupid. We were girded up with supplies even though it was supposed to be a quick trip---three flashlights each, water bottles, even granola bars. [@fridgetunnel>Niko had a pad of yellow sticky notes and flipped the edges of it compulsively, nervous: “in case we need to mark our way,” he explained.]\n\nWe'd never seen anything dangerous down there, exactly. We just knew something wasn't right, now. That it wasn't just a basement down there.\n\n{i/We knew.} We knew nothing. The truth is that despite our attempts to rationalize, to explain, we were blind. Shooting in the dark. Grasping at straws from sci-fi movies and bad dreams. \n\nWe had no idea what was happening to us.\n\nWe headed down, quietly so as not to wake our housemates. Once we got Downstairs, we followed the well-beaten path toward the room with the pool and the fridge. Niko was jumpy, especially when we got to the first staircase into the dark zone. Every shadow seemed ominous and he muttered suspicions at everything. “I think this door moved,” or, “Someone's been here, I can feel it.” I tried my best to keep things light, to reassure him. [@fridgetunnel>He started idly doodling flip-book animations of a gruesome hanging on the pad of sticky notes.]\n\nOn our way down the twisting stairs to the {room shape name} room, he stopped at one landing and glanced down the hall branching off from it. With a choke, he stiffened and leapt back, gripping the flashlight like a sword. \n\n“Jesus fucking Christ,” he hissed. “What the [hell|shit] is that?”\n\nI looked.\n\nWay down the hallway, past the reach of the flashlight, were two tiny glints, hovering maybe four feet off the ground, deep in the darkness.\n\n[Eyes.]\n\nMy heart rate was through the roof and I couldn't breathe, but I raised my flashlight too, shined it down the hall. It revealed nothing but the glints. I felt paralyzed. But I saw how scared Niko was. How close both of us were to panic.\n\nI gave him a mock salute. “Later, skater,” I said, and started down the hall.\n\n“The fuck are you doing?” Niko hissed from behind me. But I kept moving. I kept walking forward, eyes fixed on the glints, willing my light to get stronger, willing those eyes to resolve into something explainable, something benign.\n\n“Shit,” Niko said, and followed me. “Shit shit shit.”\n\nIt only took a few more steps before we realized our mistake.\n\nThe hall ended in a T-junction. About four feet off the floor was one of those fake candelabra. The glints had been our flashlights, reflecting off its dull metal sheen.\n\nI laughed; it was easy with all the relief flooding through me. “See? There's enough weird shit going on without jumping at shadows.”\n\nNiko forced a laugh out too, but his face was still pale and tense. “How could you tell? From back there?”\n\nI shrugged. “I couldn't. This was the quickest way to find out.”\n\n“Great. My hero. Glad you weren't mauled by a shadowbear.” But he was smiling now for real, and looking at me with respect. \n\n{i/He was right. That was stupid. Bravado is exactly the wrong response to what's happening.}\n\n“Let's hurry and get this over with.” [@fridgetrapped>I turned to walk back to the landing.\n\nBut as we walked away, I couldn't help remembering how those glints had looked in the darkness, before they'd resolved into something explainable. Like eyes. Watching. \n\n{i/Just because it’s not real doesn’t mean it can’t hurt.}\n\nI didn't look back.|We walked back to the landing. Niko wrote “NOT THIS WAY” on a sticky note and slapped it on the wall, drawing an arrow down the hall. I added a smiley face; he grabbed the pen back and drew some demon eyebrows on it.\n]\n\nWe made it the rest of the way to the pool room without incident, and climbed the ladder. [@fridgetrapped>Nothing was waiting for us, which I found mildly deflating, and seemed to validate Niko's black mood. “Although it makes sense, statistically,” I tried to point out. “Four out of twenty-four. There's only a one in six chance they'd have gotten an earlier time.”\n\nFeeling dumb, we positioned our note on the floor directly in front of the fridge. The message we'd decided on was simple, three lines on my dad's old “While You Were Out” memo pad:\n\n{verse_inline/Hey, it's us. \\\\\n\tCan we have a key? \\\\\n\tWe'd like a way back.}\n\nIt felt ridiculous signing our own names to ourselves, so we'd signed it with a smiley face.\n\nNiko had left the carbon copy in his room as a record of the transaction, which made us feel more secure about the whole thing even if neither of us had any idea what use that could possibly be.\n\nWe lingered, but in theory every minute increased the odds of an overlap. So before long we dropped back down to the concrete pool floor and headed back towards the top.\n\nOn the way back up the twisting stairs, Niko paused at the same landing to look down the side hallway. He stopped again, but this time with a frown.\n\n“It's gone,” he said. \n\nWe peered down the hall, flashlights held high. There were no glints now in the darkness at the end of the hall.\n\n“Probably a different angle,” I said, not very convincingly. I cleared my throat, trying to sound like the hero he'd made me out to be earlier. “Um. Should we go look, do you think? See if it's moved or something?”\n\nHe was still staring down the hallway. His expression hadn't changed, and his voice was calm. “No,” he said. “No, I don't think so. I think we should go back upstairs now.”\n\n“Is there, uh. Do you see...?”\n\nMy knees felt weak. {i/Some hero.}\n\nHis eyes flicked to mine, then back down the hall. Our flashlight beams made it only halfway down its length before darkness swallowed them. Somewhere at the gray and ghostly edges of our light, photons stopped bouncing back to us. The vanishing point drank them up. We strained to see through that darkness, but it was impenetrable. \n\nThe silence was almost painful.\n\nAbruptly Niko turned and started up the steps, calm and quiet and not looking back, and I was right behind him.\n\n{i/Good call.}\n\nOnce we got back up to the house ({i/their house}, a voice in my head reminded me) we went out onto the porch to decompress. Niko smoked a cigarette, something he'd given up multiple times, but I wasn't in the mood to play life coach again. We'd had vague thoughts of catching the sunrise, but it was still too early for even a hint of dawn.\n\n“So we learned something,” he finally said, flicking ash. “We know there's something down there. An intelligence.”\n\n“How do you figure?” I was blindsided by this.\n\n“The glints. Something knows we're down there. It's fucking with us.”\n\n“You're reading way too much into it.” I didn't want any part of this theory. “We probably weren't standing at the same angle, or were holding our lights different. Something. Besides, weren't you the one joking about shadowbears? Where do you get off now with ‘an intelligence?’”\n\nHe got up and stubbed out his cigarette. “Something made all that,” he said, and went back inside.\n\nHe stayed in his room all the next day.\n\n|I was on edge, waiting for any signs of that sick feeling of wrongness, but nothing happened, and there were no creepy doppelgängers waiting for us above the lip of the pool. \n\n“Okay,” Niko said, clapping his hands: he was spooked too, I could tell. “Let's do this. You want to do the honors?”\n\nI pulled out the bent key and slipped it into the lock, turned it. It rotated with a smooth snick. I pulled the handle, and as I tugged the fridge door open past the familiar suction, the light inside came on.\n\nNiko let out a strangled gasp and bent down, staring inside the door in horror. I stood frozen, still gripping the handle, unable to process what my eyes were telling me.\n\nBecause inside was no longer a vinyl-padded room and the inside of another door. Instead, we were staring down a smooth, white, rectangular tunnel, that went on and on as far as we could see.\n\n{chapter/6}\n\n“What the fuck is this?” Niko hissed. I didn't have an answer. We stared into the bright white hallway like it was a road to heaven, or to hell.\n\nThe first few feet were the same as when we'd passed through before, the same as the interior of any ordinary fridge. Vinyl walls, plastic crisper drawers below the clear floor, a tiny bright bulb in the ceiling. But it didn't end. It kept going. Every few feet another little white bulb above; vinyl walls extending farther and farther; and an endless highway of clear plastic shelf for a floor, eight inches above the vinyl floor. The lines extended to a perfect vanishing point, and for as far as we could see, nothing changed.\n\nFor the next few hours, we did our best to interrogate this new unwanted truth, but gained no new understanding, came no closer to reconciling it with our plans to go back through. First we threw some wadded-up sticky notes and granola bars down the tunnel. When nothing happened to them, we ventured inside. Walking was hard: the ceiling was too low to stand up straight, so you had to move forward in an awkward shuffle. We only made it a hundred feet in before we had to turn back: Niko had been looking over his shoulder every few seconds to make sure the door back out hadn't vanished while we'd turned our backs on it, and eventually bumped his head one too many times on the ceiling and had a full-on claustrophobic panic attack. We retreated, hearts racing and muscles cramping. The next hundred feet had looked just as identical, anyway.\n\nWe tried locking the fridge and unlocking it again, turning the key and opening the door a dozen different ways, like it was a car with an unreliable starter you needed the right knack to handle. The door always opened on that same impossible tunnel. We tried shouting down the tunnel, or staying quiet and listening, but our voices were swallowed up and the silence stayed relentless, unbroken except for the quiet hums of the row of tiny lights. Later we got braver, tried more drastic measures: Niko had a pocketknife and we took it to the tunnel walls. Underneath the vinyl was more vinyl. We gouged out a chunk eight inches deep before giving up. The floor felt like flimsy plastic, bending a little with our weight, but no amount of vigorous stomping shattered or even cracked it.\n\n“We could get a bunch of food, mount an expedition,” I suggested, half-heartedly. {i/It can't go on forever,} I wanted to say, but couldn't bring myself to. He didn't answer.\n\nFinally, we gave up.\n\nWe climbed back down the ladder to the empty pool and stepped back into the hall. I was trying to think of next steps, more plans, but my body and mind were exhausted. I turned to pull the pool door shut behind us.\n\nAs I did I noticed a small yellow square was stuck to it.\n\n“Niko,” I gasped, breath failing me, “oh {i/shit}. There's a note. Someone left a note.”\n\nWe stared at it, afraid to touch it. We saw immediately that it was the one we'd left earlier, at the junction with the glints. “NOT THIS WAY,” it said in Niko's handwriting. But the smiley face with the demon eyebrows looked sinister now, malevolent.\n\nThe arrow pointed toward the pool room, and the fridge.\n\n“It's them,” Niko breathed, sagging back against the opposite wall, as far away from the note as possible. “Our doubles. They moved it. My god, Ry. They came here and moved it. They were right outside.”\n\nMy mind whirled. “Then that means there must be another way through. Some way for them to get here.”\n\n“Maybe.” He swallowed, face pale. “Or maybe there's something else going on. Something's down here with us, man. Fucking with us.”\n\n{maybe explain more bit}\n\nWe stared at the note.\n\n{i/NOT THIS WAY.}\n\nThe silence was almost painful.\n\nAbruptly Niko turned and started back down the hall, toward the surface, not talking, not looking back. I was right behind him.\n\n]\n[MACRO maybe explain more bit][“I don't understand.” I grimaced, mind still working on my theory. “If they know another way through, why the fuck wouldn't they have left a note telling us where it is? Telling us how to get back?”\n\n“Maybe they can't,” he said quietly. I looked at him. “Maybe things are already too out of sync. The connection through the fridge. Maybe we... broke it. Somehow. It snapped. And they don't want to make it any worse. Maybe moving the note is less dangerous than... {i/fuck}, man, I don't know. I don't know.”]\n\n{section_break}\n\nWhen I was a kid I got way into swimming one year, another obsession. I started going to the rec center pool every day after school, having mom drop me off there on weekends. They had a swim program and I shot through all the rankings. Minnow, Fish, Flying Fish, Salmon, Shark, Tiger Shark. I swam. I don't recall especially enjoying it: it was just something I did, like a job. Then at school one day someone asked me why I was so into it and I couldn't tell them. I could hold my breath for forever, which helped, but hardly seemed like a good reason. The truth was I had no idea why I was doing it, and that terrified me. What had made me start? I couldn't remember. I felt almost violated, possessed, like some outside force had tricked me into driving all my thoughts and energies into moving back and forth through lanes of water, over and over again, for months on end. I stopped not long after, in part because I was hitting puberty and changing clothes in front of other guys was becoming more and more mortifying, but I think really it was because I couldn't explain that compulsion and it scared me.\n\nI felt it again, now. [@fridgetrapped>I wanted to be back Downstairs.|I wanted to stay Downstairs.] Sure, I could rationalize this away: the only way back home was down [@fridgetrapped>there, it was an excuse to spend time with Niko, we had an experiment to follow up on|here]. But the real reason was that I wanted to find out what was down there, more than anything. I was driven to. Something was driving me. At least that's how it felt.\n\nI didn't mention any of this to Niko. I knew if I did it might put him off exploring altogether.\n\n[@fridgetrapped>We went down to follow up on our experiment when he came out of his funk, at the end of a nervous afternoon of excuses. Eventually he couldn't put me off any more. I had to see if there'd been a response to our note.\n\nThe route was getting familiar. We traced our way through the upper hallways, down the long stair into the dark zone, through to the {room shape name} room, and down the twisting stairs with the weird landings. When we passed the one with the glints, neither of us stopped. We pointedly did not even glance down it. Glints, no glints: neither would have been especially reassuring.\n\nWe passed down the stretch with no doors to the pool room, and pulled ourselves up the ladder, but to our vague disappointment, we saw at once that nothing had changed. Our note was still sitting in front of the fridge where we'd left it. No key. No sign anyone had been there since us.\n\nNiko tugged half-heartedly on the fridge door. Still locked.\n\n“Maybe our theory's wrong,” I said. “Lots of guesswork in there.”\n\n“But which part?” He slumped against the fridge in frustration. “Shit. Back to ground zero, I guess.”\n\n“Not necessarily.” I didn't want him to lose hope. “Maybe something came up on their side and they couldn't make it down yesterday. Or, you know, they got eaten by the shadowbear.” Niko didn't smile. I shrugged. “Let's give them another day or two.”\n\nHe was gripping his temples. “I'm getting sick of these headaches, man. I'm {i/tired} of this. We've been acting like everything's okay but it's not, it's really profoundly not. How much time you think we have to figure this thing out? Something's slipping away, Ry. Can't you feel it?”\n\nSighing, I bent down to pick up the note. I stared again at what we'd written: Niko's handwriting, the words, our little three-line koan to ourselves. Stupid. Of course nothing had happened. We were inventing causalities out of pure fantasy, trying to operate a machine without knowing how it worked or if it even existed. Maybe we didn't have alter egos in some other dimension. Maybe…\n\nI blinked. I'd been staring at the note this whole time. Something had been bothering me about it, though I hadn't consciously realized what. But now, like an optical illusion popping into place, I did.\n\nThe note was almost the same as the one we'd left. But not quite.\n\n“Niko,” I gasped, breath failing me, “it changed. It's a different note. Oh, {i/shit}. They wrote back.”\n\nHe grabbed it from me, and for a second I could see him struggle to see it, because the change was so small. This note had the same handwriting, was written on the same memo pad sheet. Then it clicked for him too, and his jaw clenched tight.\n\nThe message was still right in the middle, just as ours had been. Only a couple words had changed. Like they'd been trying to convey a new meaning with the smallest amount of difference.\n\n{verse_inline/Hey, it's us. \\\\\n\tCan not have a key. \\\\\n\tYou'd stay a way back.}\n\nIt was still signed with a smiley face. But now instead of dots for eyes above the curved mouth, there were circles. Big ones. Like someone wide-eyed with fear, or shock. \n\nGrinning.\n\nI looked at the chrome surface of the locked refrigerator, and my skin started to crawl.\n]\n\n\n"

Niko went out the front door[, I assumed to take a walk,] without a word. I lay on my bed listening to records until I got too creeped out imagining what might be underneath me, and went out to curl up on the porch swing, instead.\n\nThe summer air was hot, with only the hint of a breeze, but felt infinitely better than the cold dead air down there.\n\nI tried to think of anything else, but something kept dragging my brain Downstairs, as if it was too heavy to stay on the surface with me. No matter how often I clawed my way onto other topics, Downstairs and all the things we didn't know about it dominated my thoughts.\n\nI had no idea what we should do next.\n\nWhen Niko came back it was with a brown bag from the liquor store, and he went straight up to his room, not even looking at me. [I should have stopped him but] I didn't feel like talking to him either. \n\nWe didn't know what was going on; we didn't know how to stop it. We didn't know anything.\n\nWe might have stayed in our funk for another couple days, except something happened the next morning.\n\nThe local history lady had left me a voicemail at around 7:15, a solid fantasy movie and credits before I normally woke up. She'd been useless when I'd stopped by before, and her tone of voice in the message---“something a bit exciting's come to light about your house”---made me assume she'd dredged up some trivia as a pretense to get me to come back and keep her company. Maybe get me to join the local history society myself. A warm-blooded young person like myself could even aspire to become treasurer.\n\nSo it was a couple hours before I got around to calling her back and asking when would be a good time to come over.\n\n“Oh, come right away,” she said, voice syrupy. “This really can't wait. Just wait till you see what I've found.”\n\nNot at all encouraged, I agreed to head over, and biked the mile or so to her [run-down|fastidiously tidy] house. The visit got off to an ugly start when she asked why I hadn't brought my colored friend this time. “Actually, he's Greek,” I said through clenched teeth, and then wished I had the guts to say something else. She served me tea again, weak to the point of tastelessness, and spent so much time making small talk I'd convinced myself she hadn't found anything and this whole exercise was a waste of time. Worse, she kept glancing at my pride bracelet and pursing her lips, and then pretending not to have done either. I wanted to get out of there but was too mentally exhausted to remember how social interactions were supposed to work, what niceties would bring a conversation to an end. [She was rolling me out with polite nothings and platitudes, like dough, and I couldn't escape it.]\n\nThe third or fourd time I pressed her about what she'd found, she got up with a [smug|triumphant] smile and bustled out, returning a minute later with a file folder holding a few photocopies.\n\n“I did some digging on your address,” she said, “and found something rather interesting.” [She turned the last two words into an annoying sing-song. {i/Raaaaather intressting.} Trying to tune her out,|She pressed up against me as she handed over the file, a bony shoulder and cloying perfume crowding into my personal space.

[*Ch6ResearchResults*@vortex>It was a blurry copy of an old newspaper {ad bit} some attraction called “{sc/THE VORTEX}.” {pp} I noticed the {ad detail bit} and almost choked on my tea. {pp} The ad looked for all the world like one of those terrible roadside attractions desperate for tourist dollars. {sc/MADAME ZOLA WILL READ YOUR FORTUNE}, {sc/MEET BOBO THE CHUCKLING CLOWN}, that kind of thing. {sc/IF YOU ONLY KNEW WHAT AWAITS YOU}.\n\nTowards the bottom, though, an image caught my eye. It was a drawing of two identical women with wavy, crimped hair and a distant expression, sad and remote. Actually, it looked like the same drawing printed twice, side by side. Both women stared vaguely down and to the left. {sc/THE SISTERS}, said a caption above them, and then, below and smaller, the word {scwide/DESCEND}.\n\nRunning through the ad was something like a ribbon that, on peering closer, seemed meant to be a stylized stream of water. This was confirmed by a rhyme running alongside one part of it, in tiny, florid print:\n\n{verse/A looking-glass held above this stream \\\\ Will show your troubles like a dream}\n\nThere was no further explanation. Admission to the Vortex was ten cents and it was closed Sundays.\n\n{scwide/DESCEND.}\n\n{nextpage} The second page was a short newspaper clipping about the Vortex being shut down---not over a grisly murder or string of disappearances but, of all things, a zoning controversy. A new mayor had instigated a crackdown on businesses operating improperly out of residential districts. There was no date but “1934” had been scrawled in pencil on the photocopy. \n\nThe final page was at first a mystery, an article---maybe even older than the Vortex ad---about an old Army post being torn down to make way for new housing. I pieced together from a few contextual clues (“the new university”, “on top of the hill”) that this was my neighborhood, and felt a sinking hunch our house was on the site of the old post.\n\nThe article recounted in brief the fort's unstoried history, built on the site of a spring which “bubbled up from a natural cavern” bricked up when the place was constructed.|@gardens>It was a blurry copy of an old newspaper {ad bit} some attraction called “{sc/THE ENDLESS GARDENS}.” {pp} I noticed the {ad detail bit} and almost choked on my tea. {pp} Our house had once stood on the site of a large private garden, it seemed, collected by a woman the ad assumed needed no introduction: {sc/THE RENOWNED HORTICULTURALIST MADAME LUCIA DE LA FONTAINE}. The gardens were apparently extensive---{sc/ACRES AND ACRES}, the copy read, which to be fair was a more defensible claim about their extent than calling them endless.\n\nThe next clipping, a review entitled “A Stroll In Fontaine's Fantastical Forest,” described the wide range of plants brought to the gardens from all around the world which “seem to have grown prodigiously in their new soil despite wildly varying climes of origin, fed by an effervescent spring bubbling up from deep beneath the earth.” The reviewer's chief complaint was that the vegetation was so dense and the paths so prolific that “it is all too easy to become lost,” allowing with a note of unease that the gardens were “perhaps too large.”\n\nMadame de La Fontaine herself, briefly profiled, came off like an out-of-touch heiress who had poured a fortune into the gardens, ignoring the advice of experts that the plants she'd uprooted were unlikely to survive here. She seemed to have taken a great deal of delight in proving them wrong. “It is indeed my fondest hope,” the article quoted her as saying, “that this small corner of Eden will continue to grow and thrive here, so I may share with visitors both present and future a small part of the arboreal wonders I have seen in my travels around the globe.”\n\nThe date on the photocopied review was from the spring of 1879.\n\n{nextpage} There was a short clipping announcing that de La Fontaine's gardens had been closed to the public, with a reference to an unexplained “disappearance.” Of the lady herself? It wasn't clear. {i/1892} was scrawled in pencil on the back.\n\nNext was another advertisement, this one for a bank. This would have seemed incongruous except for the illustration that clearly showed our house, or how it must have looked brand new. The overall impression was of overwhelming success: the {ad was festooned}: {sc/YOUR FUTURES ARE SAFE WITH US}, and {sc/EXPANDING ONCE AGAIN}, and {sc/WE WELCOME NEW CLIENTS}, and finally {sc/THE LORENZO TRIPLETS}.\n\nThis last ribbon was draped over a small oval portrait in the lower right of three mustachioed men. Actually it looked like the same portrait printed three times, side by side. Tiny florid text beneath read {sc/WE ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE, EVERY DAY AT ANY HOUR} and {sc/WE WILL NEVER STOP INVESTING IN YOUR FUTURE} and, even bolder underneath that:\n\n{scwide/WE NEVER TIRE.}\n\nThe final clipping was from a few years later, an official notice that the bank had been shut down. Apparently vast reserves of counterfeit money had been discovered in the basement. \n\nMy heart thumped, somewhere in my chest. None of this made sense in the large but bits and pieces seemed disturbingly familiar. Expansion. Duplication. Impossible dreams. I started at the portrait of the three men. Three. Why {i/three}?\n|@snakeoil>It was a blurry copy of an old newspaper {ad bit} some product called “{sc/DR. HENNESON'S MAGICAL TINCTURES}.” {pp} I noticed the {ad detail bit} and almost choked on my tea. {pp} The house in the picture was ours, no question about it: much newer and without the later extensions, but still. The {ad was festooned}: {sc/RESTORATIVE ELIXIRS} and {sc/WONDROUS CURE-ALLS} and {sc/SUCH WONDERS AWAIT YOU}. Tiny print along the bottom praised Dr. Henneson's unmatched skill at distilling his own secret medicinal ingredients from “the cleansing waters of an underground stream of utmost effervescent purity.” The copy got less and less believable as it rambled on: “praised by the crowned heads of Europe” and “a cure to all diseases known by man and science” and “the true American fountain of youth” and so on. \n\n{nextpage} The second page was a similar ad, but now the drawing of the house had been replaced with a sketch of a series of steaming tubs carved out of rock. {sc/ENJOY OUR HEALING GROTTOS}, the ribbons said now, and {sc/BATHE IN THE WARMTH OF THE PURE WATERS OF LIFE}, and finally, even bolder underneath that: {sc/EXPANDING ONCE AGAIN}.\n\nExpanding.\n\nThe final clipping was a short article giving notice that the house at our address, now billed more prosaically as “site of the discredited ‘Doctor' Henneson's smorgasbord of quackery,” had been condemned for “unsafe building practices” and was scheduled for immediate demolition. Apparently “in the wake of the building's abandonment” an appraiser had become concerned by “unauthorized constructions and extensions” and alerted city safety inspectors, who had deemed the building “unsound in the extreme.” The final paragraph also alluded to a “disappearance” but failed to specify whose. Henneson's?\n\nThat was the last clipping in the stack. There was no more about the disappearance and no explanation for why the unsound house had never been demolished after all and had survived, seventy years later, to be rented out to college students.\n|@caves>It was a blurry copy of an old newspaper article, maybe from around the turn of the century. I didn't see the relevance until a few contextual clues started popping out at me (“by the new university”; “on top of the hill”) and I realized where the entrance to this cave was. I almost choked on my tea.\n\nIt was about a search for two kids who had gotten lost in an underground cave, dating from a summer in 1931. Two neighborhood boys, 15 and 17, had gone exploring in the caves and never come back out. Rescuers sent down had heard faint voices, and it was suspected the pair had been boxed in by rising water. Brave men had tried swimming through flooded passages, but none had been successful at reaching the boys. Some rescuers had proposed digging a shaft down to them from the surface, but none could agree where to dig: different rescuers had heard the voices coming from very different places, saying very different things. \n\nThe next article, dated a day later, was a short history of the cave, most likely a filler piece given a lack of new rescue details to report. The cave had been a source of trouble before, it seemed: a forbidden but popular spot for local youths, it had never been mapped but was not believed to be extensive. But it was treacherous in part because of a spring which bubbled up from its depths with unpredictable rhythms, sometimes flooding lower passages or resmoothing upper ones. The spring's varying flow erased markers and made it hard to tell the twisting tunnels apart, making the cave seem “far larger than its true extent.” It had no official name but the locals had given it various nicknames, among the most popular of which was Looking-Glass Cave, after the clear pool the spring waters sometimes left at its entrance. The article explained that this was a reference to a Robert Louis Stevenson poem taught in local schools which all the kids knew, and which the article reprinted in its entirety. Some of the verses seemed uncomfortably on-the-nose.\n\n{verse/Sailing blossoms, silver fishes, \\\\\nPave pools as clear as air--- \\\\\nHow a child wishes \\\\\nTo live down there! \\\\\n \\\\\nWe can see our coloured faces \\\\\nFloating on the shaken pool \\\\\nDown in cool places, \\\\\nDim and very cool}\n\n{nextpage} The remaining articles painted a grim picture of the subsequent week of rescue attempts, the breathless updates unable to disguise the fact that all had failed. Squabbling about the proper dig site, fears of digging too aggressively and causing a cave-in, a surge of flooding from the spring which was flowing “with unusual vigor” that season, and ever-growing crowds of spectators all delayed and complicated the rescue efforts.\n\nThe final article was short, the tone terse, only the headline betraying a hint of pathos: {sc/CAVE SEARCH CALLED OFF: SURELY NO HOPE LEFT FOR YOUNG SPELUNKERS}. It announced that after fifteen days the rescue efforts had been abandoned. No voices had been heard from anywhere in days, and the boys were presumed drowned, starved, or buried---dead, one way or another. The cave entrance was to be sealed for good, the spring bricked up to prevent its no-longer-pure water from reaching the surface. No future generations of children would stare wistfully into its pools clear as air.\n\nWith the article, for the first time, were pictures of the two boys.\n\nThey stared out from oval windows, sketched in ink, probably sourced from the descriptions of grieving mothers rather than life. They looked younger than their reported ages. I stared back at them, unable to stop from wondering what their story had been, what it must have been like to die down there. Alone except for each other. Had they been lifelong friends? Or casual schoolmates exploring the cave on a whim? Did their final days bring them closer together, or tear them apart?]\n[@vortex>Nothing much of note had ever happened there. Built to keep white settlers safe from the natives they were busy exterminating, the post had never been attacked or even threatened.\n\n“Once the fort was built and the spring bricked up, the Indians never again came near the place,” the old article said by way of explanation.\n\nShe must have caught me staring at this sentence, because she leaned over and tapped it with a pencil. “Haunted.” Her grin was smug.\n\n“Excuse me?”\n\n“Been seeing spirits, have you?” she asked. “Must be an old burial ground. Read a book about it once. When they're disturbed, young man, the ghosts of redskins get {i/very} angry.”\n\nI looked up at her with a flash of anger. “I think we say Native Americans now. And there's no ghosts. That's not it.” I didn't know how, but I'd never been more sure of anything.|@gardens>\n\nShe noticed me looking and tapped the portrait with a pencil. “Italians,” she said with a smug little smile, “can't trust them.”\n\nIt took me a full five seconds to recover from this cognitive shift. “Excuse me?”\n\n“‘A Dago organ-grinder plays at my door each day,'” she quoted in a singsong. “‘And then a Dago damsel asks me to pay, pay, pay!'” She chuckled. “From something mother used to sing me. I know it's not fashionable to say those things any more, but there's truth in old rhymes. Wouldn't put {i/my} money in an Italian bank, that's all I'm saying. Did you find some old counterfeit banknotes in your cellar, young man?” She leaned closer; her breath smelled awful. “Were they”---she winked---“still greasy?”\n\nI recoiled from her, hot anger kindling somewhere inside me. “No,” I said, “I didn't. And I don't think their nationality had anything to do with it. At all.” I'd never been more sure of anything in my life.|@snakeoil>\n\nI turned back to the first article and stared at it. The history lady noticed me staring and tapped it with a discolored fingernail. “Voodoo,” she said.\n\n“Excuse me?”\n\n“Doesn't say here, but Henneson's a Negro name.” She sniffed, disdainful. “This kind of thing was quite common back in those days. Lots of his type coming through after the Depression, selling snake oil, or worse. Black magic. Letting the Devil loose on good and decent folk. Preying on their sickness.”\n\n“I'm pretty sure there were a lot of white con artists, too,” I said, trying to control my anger.\n\n“Been seeing ghosts in that house, have you?” she asked, ignoring me. “No wonder. Lord knows what terrible things he did to people, down in those grottos.”\n\n“There's no ghosts. That's not it. And I'm pretty sure it's not voodoo either.” I didn't know how, but I'd never been more sure of anything in my life. I got to my feet, face flushed. “So I think I'm going to head out now because I don't think you have a goddamned clue what you're talking about.”\n|@caves>\n\nThe old woman caught me looking and smiled knowingly. “Been hearing their voices, have you?”\n\n“I'm sorry?”\n\n“Lost souls,” she said, “haunted. Not right to brick up a stream where a thing like that's happened. Keep that trauma bottled up.”\n\n“I don't think that's it,” I said, annoyed. I didn't believe in ghosts and hadn't heard any teenage voices sobbing in the night. “By that logic, any river anywhere should be haunted. I mean, twenty thousand people died building the Panama Canal, and you don't hear about---”\n\n“The ringleader was probably the Mexican one,” she interrupted, tapping one of the pencils with a portrait.\n\nIt took me a full five seconds to recover from this cognitive shift. “Uh, what?”\n\n“Maybe looking for a good place to hide,” she said, matter-of-fact, still tapping the portrait. I looked down stupidly: one of the boys, I supposed, did have darker skin than the other. “Lots of deportations back then, during the Depression. The Spanish boy must have talked the other one into doing something foolish. Pity. Probably didn't have much education, didn't realize how dangerous those caves were.” She grinned and her mouth was full of rotting teeth. “Of course, they are very good at swimming rivers.”\n\nHot anger kindled somewhere inside me, overcoming my usual shyness. “That's a shitty thing to say about two dead boys.”\n]\n[MACRO ad was festooned][~ad was festooned with decorative ribbons with all-caps slogans swirling artfully around the house]\n[MACRO nextpage][~I flipped to the other few pages in the folder as the woman twittered on about her sleuthing skills in the county archives.]\n\nShe puckered her mouth, glanced again at my pride bracelet. “Well. Should have realized you'd be the {i/sensitive} type.”\n\nI couldn't take this any more. Her racist bullshit aside, the notion that what was happening to me was a cute [@snakeoil>ghost story|@caves>ghost story|mystery] for her to solve was so disconnected from the growing existential dread of the past few days I wanted to slap her. [I tried to remember she'd done me a favor, but in that moment I couldn't stand her.] She was everyone who thought my problems had simple explanations, [everything wrong with a world that was broken and couldn't be bothered to care about fixing itself|everyone who thought casting victims as villains made for good stories]. For a moment, brief and burning, I hated her.\n\nAnd that's when her face came unstuck.\n\nThis was back when movies were still celluloid, and at the [second-run|dollar|drive-in] theater by our house the film would sometimes jump the gate, get misaligned. When that happened the image would smear, frames no longer projected neat one after the other but running liquid through the machine, all movement turned into vertical bands of distorted color; and the audio would go juddery, vague, and distant, recognizable but distorted. Clipped and monstrous.\n\nThis was like that but in three dimensions.\n\nThe woman exploded. Her face twisted and smeared, exposing blood and bone. The back of her tongue flapped against her pulsing epiglottis, her eyes round spheres peeling back, turning inside out, her lips deformed and pulled like taffy into a twisting shape that reached from the ceiling to her knees. Her fingers had gone long as tree branches and skinny like pencils, twisting and jerking backward at frantic angles; the pattern of her dress had multiplied and filled the empty spaces in the air and was so thick now I choked on it. Everything moved, everything in her sounded, and the sound was a scream, like her lungs were jet engines, her voice box a bleating thing the size of a cow being flayed alive.\n\nI dropped the teacup and the files: I vaguely remember them tumbling toward the floor in slow motion, spilling and twisting around each other. I was screaming too. All I wanted was to get away. I stumbled back and my head cracked against a cabinet of china plates; I held up my hands to shield myself, as if such a pathetic act could matter against a thing so huge and horrible. It came toward me, moving fast. I couldn't stop it. My sanity frayed.\n\nAnd then she snapped back into herself, and her voice returned to normal. Almost. It still juddered, like the floor beneath her vibrated a hundred times a second. And her skin was boiling and rippling, like something inside it was desperate to get out. Thousands of tiny somethings pushing and pounding with disproportionate strength against her wrinkled flesh.\n\nShe reached toward me---and maybe this was all in my head, maybe she was trying to help, reacting in shock to my reaction, what must have seemed like some kind of seizure---but as she opened her mouth to speak, the rippling distortions made it into a grin. A huge, horrible, ravenous grin, malevolent. Gleeful.\n\nHer reaching fingers writhed, and her eyes were wide and round as saucers.\n\nI jerked to my feet and ran.\n\nFor a while I didn't even know what direction I was running. I bolted straight through intersections and past oblivious pedestrians, not seeing them. I wasn't thinking about anything at all. I didn't stop until a knife in my side brought me up short, bent me double, and I realized I'd been running a long time.\n\nI collapsed on a patch of hot grass and threw up, retching and gasping. Gnats scribbled the air around me. Somewhere a dog barked.\n\nI stayed there five or ten minutes, breathing jagged, looking down, studying my hands on the grass and my puke, dealing with those three things, the hands and the grass and the puke, not wanting or able to look up or deal with anything else. Nothing happened. After a while that started to help.\n\nEventually I climbed to my feet, got my bearings. I realized I knew where I was. I walked slowly back to our house. \n\nI never went back for my bike.\n\n{section_break}\n\nWhen I got home, Niko was gone. I let myself into his bedroom and curled up on his bed, because I needed to be surrounded by something familiar. The smell of him was an anchor to reality. Maybe the only one.\n\n[I came in here sometimes when he was gone, usually only when he left the door unlocked. I didn’t touch anything. I just wanted to see the pieces of his life in isolation from his too-bright self, read the story they told about him with no silhouette from that burning corona. Once I’d seen a brochure from the campus LGBT center in his trash can, and wondered about that for a long time: why he’d taken it, why he’d thrown it away.]\n\n[DEFINE @bubbles|@shadows]\n\nI must have drifted off, because moments later the afternoon light was dying and his hand was on my shoulder, shaking it. I jerked awake, guilty excuses on my lips[@bubbles> before I realized he didn't seem concerned about me breaking in. His hair was matted and he had a distant expression, staring past me.\n\n“I took a piss,” he said quietly, as if to someone standing behind my left shoulder, “and the bubbles were like eyes. There were thousands of them, floating. Staring. Iridescent, like oil. Something grinning underneath them, though, behind them. Something babbling and grinning and hungry and even when I closed the lid and flushed them away I could still hear them, down there, all of them...”\n\nI sat up,|@shadows>. He was screaming at me.\n\n“What the {i/fuck} are you doing in here?” His face twisted with a rage I'd never seen there, sharp and ragged.\n\n“I didn't... I just...” I staggered to my feet, not knowing what to say. \n\n“Get the fuck out,” he shouted, and then I saw something behind the rage: a fear, a wild, desperate fear. There were tears in his eyes. “Get out, out of my fucking room, I just want to be {i/alone},” he yelled, and as I backed up stammering he shoved me, so hard I slammed into the wall, cracking my head, and then he dropped down on his haunches and buried his face in his hands and started to sob.\n\nI would have left except I'd only heard him sob like that once before, and I couldn't stand the thought of letting him do it alone.\n\n“What happened?” I finally asked, back still pressed to the wall, afraid to move in any direction, towards him or away.\n\nHe ran his hands through his hair, staying crouched, staring at the floor. “Something's... following me,” he said at last, quiet, miserable. “Shadows. Something's wrong with the shadows.” He looked up and past me, haunted, like speaking to someone behind my shoulder. “There's too many of them. I can see them squirming out of the corner of my eye. Like they can't all fit in the shade they've been given. They're following me, wherever I move, like regular shadows except these ones are alive and thinking about me and looking at me and {i/hungry} for me, and every time I turn around there's more of them pressing into the same space, packed tight, squeezing in, wriggling, more of them each time, more and more and more and more and more...”\n\nI knelt down,]\ngrabbed his shoulders and shook him, then did it again, hard. His head flopped back and he grabbed my wrist, a faint annoyance reaching his face. I was glad to see anything there at all.\n\nI let him focus on me before saying, “There's no [@bubbles>eyes|@shadows>shadows].”\n\nHe stared at me.\n\nI shook my head, more sure of it now. “[That's not it. ]It's not [@caves>ghosts, or|@vortex>ghosts, or|@snakeoil>voodoo, or ghosts, or] a thing out there, stalking us. It {i/is} us. We're what's wrong here. We're the ones who don't belong.” I swallowed, bile still souring the back of my throat. “We're slipping. Losing our grip on... something. This whole world, maybe. Or it's losing its grip on us.”\n\nI had his full attention now. \n\n“And I don't know what happens when we let go, or it does,” I finished. “But I don't think it's good.”\n\nHe stared at me, hopeless. “There's no way back.”\n\n“[There is. There has to be.” I took a breath. “We just have to find it|No. Not yet.” I took a breath. “Not until we find one].”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He transferred our notebook sketches to the wall and we [filled|tried to fill] in the rest from memory. It was imperfect, [80>because stairs down there ran up and down and the wall was flat, and also] because the hallways twisted at weird angles and we didn't have surveying equipment to sort them out. But it was a start. \n[MACRO maybe from class][ from an old class]\n\nIt was also painfully incomplete. [There were dozens of doors we'd never tried, branches and halls we'd only glanced into.|Dozens of doors had never been opened, countless halls had only been glanced into.] Almost everything we had seen was from that single hall off the big room, the one we'd tried on a whim our first time down. Other than peering around the first couple corners, we hadn't explored the other four halls at all.\n\nNiko swept a hand across all the empty space. “We're fucked.”\n\n“Look,” I countered, “we know the other versions of us found a key, somewhere. And we also know the two sides are staying almost exactly in sync. Close enough to spill coffee the same way.”\n\n“Not close enough to leave [@fridgetrapped>the same fucking note|each others' fucking sticky notes alone].”\n\n“Still,” I pressed on, “that means the keys can't have been too well-hidden. We could have almost found one, walked right past it. Maybe the only difference was a momentary decision about which door to go through, what wall to glance at.”\n\n“Doesn't matter.” He stirred his coffee, morose, and sat it down to cool on his dresser, next to [@singular09>a brass model of a harpoon attached to what appeared to be a real whale tooth---he'd gone through a yard sale phase and loved to collect anything that changing laws, morals, or fashion sensibilities made no longer possible to acquire|a half-empty older mug growing a skim of mold]. “[@fridgetrapped>The other me already got to the key on this side and took it through with him.

Other keys, other doors.] And besides, we have no idea what else might be down there. We need to keep looking.”\n\nHe ran a hand through his hair, a familiar gesture, but he looked changed. His eyes were getting sunken, from lack of sleep or some more worrisome deficiency. His face, so often laughing, hadn't smiled in days.\n\n“Synchronicity,” he said. “That's the problem.”\n\n“How do you mean?”\n\n“I think we're getting out of sync with them. Day by day, decision by decision, we're losing our lockstep. And the [farther|further|more] out of sync we [drift, the harder it gets|get, the harder it is] to go back.”\n\n“[Speculation|Is that so][,” I said, tired.|.”]\n\n“And the deeper,” he pressed on, “the deeper we'll have to go to find another way through.”\n\n“[Bullshit|Nice. You're leaping all the way past conclusions now to the realm of utter bullshit].” But I didn't have energy to argue with him. Clearly we couldn't solve anything from up here. We needed to go back down. We had to fill in the blank spaces on that map.\n\nOur first [Expedition departed the next morning. With a capital E, Niko said, to show we were taking this shit seriously now|expedition departed the next morning]. We had backpacks, trail mix and energy bars, lots of flashlights and batteries, twine, spray paint, a compass, graph paper, whistles, and rope. Despite everything, I think the prep got us fired up a bit. If answers were down there, we'd find them. We skipped class and I called in sick to work, and we both agreed if necessary we'd do the same tomorrow, and the next day. Finding a way back was top priority.\n\n[“They're not {i/our} grades anyway,” Niko said with a smirk. I sensed a slippery slope here vis-à-vis morality and nihilism, but I wasn't in the mood to debate philosophy with him. I wanted to move. To delve. Find some answers.]\n\nWe chose one of the unexplored halls off the big room, and decided to [explore as much of it as we could, until we'd mapped|map as much of it as we could, until we'd explored] it all or got too tired to keep going. We picked the one at the far end[ of the room], opposite the stairs back up. Right away we found something different.\n\nThe first few twists and turns were [the same as what we'd seen before|like the rest of the top level|the familiar terrain we'd come to expect]: carpet, wall sconces, scuffed doors. But after a short and confusing snarl of hallways and tiny rooms, the floorplan opened up into an area with [brighter lights in the|a slightly different style of] sconces, and longer, straighter hallways.\n\n[Except some|Some] of them went straight down.\n\nWe stood at the lip of one of these pits and [stared|peered|peeked] over the edge. It was like someone had taken a regular hallway and stood it on end. The brown carpet went right over the lip and continued straight down, passing sideways doors, sideways wall sconces. Maybe seventy or eighty feet down, it hit a carpeted bottom and leveled out again, branching in opposite horizontal directions. The pit filled the exact center of a junction; we could step around the corners into hallways leading off in the three other directions from the one we'd arrived. It was a five-way intersection, all at right-angles.\n\nA couple dozen paces down one of those halls was another pit.\n\n“What is this,” Niko sighed, “challenge mode?”\n\nWhen you think of treacherous terrain a basement hallway isn't the first thing that comes to mind, but clutching the corner and peering vertiginously down, the pit looked as unscalable as the Matterhorn. There was nothing to get a grip on, except the doorways every twenty feet or so. Clearly we couldn't get down without climbing gear, nor come back up without it either.\n\nIf you fell... if you got stuck down there...\n\nWe stepped carefully around the pit [(which was awkward and terrifying because it came right up to the ninety-degree edge of the wall)] and kept exploring on the same level. But the pits were everywhere. Each horizontal hall would dead end sooner or later, and the side rooms were all small and empty. Some of them had hallway pits, too, leading down from their exact center. [After|In half] an hour we'd mapped out everything we could get to without a climbing harness. Other than going back to the big room, there was no way forward except [eleven|fourteen|sixteen] pits, each at least fifty feet deep.\n\n“[Maybe difficult is good|Difficult could be good].” [Niko|He] perked up. “This is the first thing we've had to work for. Maybe [it] means there's something interesting down there.”\n\n“Or maybe one of [those|the] other [halls|hallways] leads to a room filled floor to ceiling with keys. No point guessing.”\n\n# If Downstairs is @empty, the setting is a maze of crawlways.

[@empty>About half the doors led not to rooms, but to crawlways.\n\nThey were those half-sized doors you find sometimes that open onto water heaters or the electric meter in your house. Flush with the floor and about three-and-a-half feet tall, they opened onto similarly miniaturized corridors, snaking off in two directions for a dozen feet with T-junctions at each end.\n|All the doors on one side opened onto a vast dark room piled floor to ceiling with {furnitures}.]\n[MACRO furnitures][@tables>tables|@sofas>couches]\n\nNiko leaned casually against the door and poked his head inside with a suave expression. “Hey,” [@empty>he said to the crawlway|he called into the shadows], “How {i/you} doin'?”\n\n[@empty>We figured out pretty quick it was a maze.\n\nYou could stoop-walk, but crawling on all fours was a lot more comfortable. (For me, at least. Niko kept bumping his head and swearing.) The tiny hallways branched and split constantly, keeping to neat ninety-degree angles. Those ever-present wall sconces remained brightly lit, but the crawlway never went the same direction for long. Doors were scarce, and they all led back to normal-sized halls.\n\n|The room began like all the others, although unlit: a regular door and the same style carpet.

There was enough space to crawl between them, but nothing like a straight path: upended walls of wood or marble or metal made intermittent obstacles, and poles and supports of all materials and angles made a forest of the open space|@sofas>Couches, chairs, recliners, loveseats, and sectionals, upholstered or varnished in a hundred styles, all dusty but ranging in condition from falling apart to so new they were still wrapped in plastic. {movers bit}\n\nBut the arrangement was orderly enough that there were pathways through the furniture.

We can't risk getting lost[ down here].”\n\n“But this is easier, man. We don't need specialized equipment. Just some way to leave a path. Hansel and Gretel, like you said.”\n\nOr maybe Ariadne. I had a ball of twine in my pack, so we settled for a simple solution: tying one end to my ankle, and the other around the [@empty>half-door's knob|doorknob]. After some deliberation, we decided to keep our packs on, despite the awkwardness of crawling the [@empty>tunnels|maze] with them. Having girded ourselves with stuff, we felt naked without it now.\n\nWe set off to map. [@empty>{empty spaces or fractal}|{pp} Crawling through the maze was surreal. The furniture painted by the bright of our headlamps made us feel foolish, like kids crawling around grandma's {ch7basement} with the lights out. But the scale glimpsed in the shifting shadows, the distance traversed by our bodies and soon felt in our knees and ankles, spoke to confusing and frightening immensities, the deepness of caves, an underworld. The space went on and on. There was too much of it for reason, for safety, for sense.\n\n{maybe cardinal bit}\n\nWe moved carefully at first, stopping to map each twist and turn{dancing shadows}. But as we started to realize the extent of the space, Niko developed a new strategy: push towards the center, or at least away from the long wall we'd entered from. Find the middle, if there was one. If it didn't go on forever.]\n[MACRO ch7basement][@sofas>basement|kitchen]\n[MACRO maybe cardinal bit][Of the four cardinal directions you could move in from the big room, the maze of furniture seemed to fill one of them up entirely. The few hallways stretching that direction were like jagged tendrils reaching into the world's {storetype}.][MACRO storetype][@sofas>largest furniture surplus store|emptiest jumble sale]\n[MACRO empty spaces or fractal][{pp} It wasn't long before we realized the crawlways accounted for an oddity in our mapmaking. If you look at the blueprint of a normal house, it's economical with space. Rooms and closets and halls fit into each other like well-stacked Tetris pieces. Downstairs was not like that. Large swaths of empty space surrounded most of the rooms. Hallways went farther than they needed to, adjacent to nothing. Niko'd talked about bringing a sledgehammer down and breaking through one to see what was behind it---but now we had an idea. The maze of crawlways filled up the emptiness behind the walls. Not in any logical or sensible way, though. As we started mapping them out in a notebook, I remembered the graph paper mazes I used to draw in school. A crawlway would wrap around the outlines of what must have been a room, then double back and wrap around itself again. Sometimes a bunch of branches would split off from a small area. There were dead ends. We had no sense of whether we were on the edge of the thing, near the center, or if the geography even had a regular enough shape for those terms to signify.\n\nWe'd figured all this out before moving too far, comparing what we'd seen to our map. Niko developed a plan to push toward a direction where we thought there should be lots of empty space, and find out whether the crawlways filled that up too.|It wasn't long before we found another, even tinier door.\n\nThis one was no more than eighteen inches high. Peering inside it, we saw an even smaller crawlway, with even smaller doors running up and down its length.\n\n“That's some Alice in Wonderland shit right there,” Niko muttered.\n\nWe could maybe have squeezed into the next level of smaller crawlways without our packs, but there didn't seem to be much point. Maybe the crawlways could get fractally smaller, but we couldn't. We decided to stick to the first tier of crawlways and map out their extent.\n]\n[MACRO dancing shadows][@furnished>, trying not to be unnerved by the way our lights carved a thousand sweeping shadow-shapes out of {dunes bit}, moving and twisting like something alive]\n[MACRO dunes bit][@tables>that desert of furniture|those tunnels of furnishings]\n\nWhat happened next caught us completely unprepared.\n\nWe'd started [@empty>crawling in a promising direction|moving in a steady direction, as near as we could manage].

Cheering him up, making him smile, was so ingrained in me I barely noticed I was doing it any more. Maybe that day, I shouldn't have been. It wasn't exactly a situation to be cheerful about.\n\n{i/Do I do it because I really want him to be happy? Or is it that I can't stand it when he's sad?}\n\n“I'm not going down there again,” he said with grim finality.\n\n[Neither of us said anything|We were quiet|We both contemplated that] for a long minute.\n\n“Okay fine, I am. You're right. You win. We find a way back. Somehow.”\n\n“There's monsters up here, too,” I said softly.\n\nHe sniffed. “Or maybe we're the monsters, man. Crawled out from under[neath] the bed.”\n\n{section_break}\n\nWe decided to explore the vertical shafts, instead of going back into the [@empty>crawlways|maze]. We didn't know whether what had happened was a message or a provocation. I thought the bruises on my ankle were message enough: Keep Out. Niko argued that was exactly why we should ignore it. Wherever they don't want you to go is probably the most interesting place to be. On the other hand, maybe the message had been like fences around Chernobyl.\n\nMaybe what[ever] was farther in was worse.\n\n[STICKY_MACRO Grapples][Grapple Buddies|Grip Monkeys]\nSo we settled on the shafts, which [had the virtue of being|were] unusual and promising terrain without even mild signs of demonic infestation. One of Niko's ex-hobbies was rock climbing, but he'd stopped after the accident jacked up his wrists. Bits of gear still lingered around his overstuffed bedroom, though, so we'd assembled some rope, harnesses, carabiners, and a couple of grappling hooks [we found at|from] the sporting goods store. The box called them “{Grapples},” which seemed incongruously cheerful.\n\n[DEFINE ^@canyons]\n[@canyons>Niko took me up into the canyons to teach me some climbing and test the {Grapples}. It felt strange to leave the house, breathe hot air and smell external things, outside things, moss and leaves and rain. Climbing didn't come naturally to me but Niko was patient and a good teacher, and knew his knots and technique. By the time we were loading our packs for the next expedition, I felt reasonably confident I wouldn't immediately kill us both.]\n\nWe picked the first pit, since they all seemed about the same, and set about securing the grapples in a doorjamb in a way that would hold our weight. We'd each go down on our own rope, one at a time and using the second as backup. We also had extra {Grapples} in our pack, in case something happened to these. \n\nAlong with the usual gear, we also brought down a camcorder. We were too broke to afford the newer all-digital cameras, so we borrowed one that shot on Hi-8 tape. This was before the whole found footage craze, so we didn't think to take the camera down the pit with us and record weepy confessionals into it: we were going to leave it down the hall from the shaft, trained on the pit and our ropes and the {Grapples}, hopefully capturing anything that tried to mess with us. \n\nWhen we were ready, and since we didn't have a tripod, I left the camera on the floor a dozen paces back, pointed at the pit, and hit record. We shouldered our packs and Niko tied on to the rope. Moving carefully, he stepped over the lip, and started to rappel down the carpeted “floor” of the shaft. I watched his grapple nervously, but it held his weight, tines set deep into the solid wood of the door frame. \n\nThe bottom of the shaft seemed a mile down with Niko dangling above it, but probably only dropped about seventy feet. He moved fast and soon was stepping onto the once-again-horizontal carpet at the bottom. He shined his light back up at me and gave the all-clear.\n\nI followed him down, trying to think only in particulars about what was happening and not the terrifying big picture. I focused on [@canyons>what Niko had taught me|old climbing lessons], what my hands were doing. One thing at a time. Presently I'd made it down too.\n\nThe hall at the bottom of the pit stretched off to either side, like we were at the junction of an upside-down T. Detaching from our dangling ropes, we picked a direction and began to explore.\n\nThings got weird down there.\n\nThe hallways continued on as they had above, and there were more pits. But [now they|these] didn't go straight down. Not quite. They descended at angles ranging from [severe to subtle|subtle to severe], never quite true to vertical. Some were almost ramps. Others changed their angle or gradually twisted as they dropped. And while the pit we'd rappelled down was lit, none of these were. [All of them|Each|They|They each] plunged down into darkness.\n\n[There were more of them, too|And there were more of them]. A lot more. [Maybe hundreds|Hundreds|Hundreds, maybe|Dozens and dozens]. Most opened from the middle of a hallway, filling its width: easy to jump across, but wearing a pack you felt clumsy, were acutely aware you were one stumble away from a very bad time.\n\nWe decided to avoid [any] unnecessary leaps, but the pits were so thick they hedged us in, pushed us inexorably [towards an unknown destination|in certain directions|in a certain direction]. If we tried to veer too far off course, they'd get denser, and we'd have to backtrack or turn aside, angling back to our former heading. And the [farther we went that way|longer we followed it], the more the hallway angles edged off true.\n\nIt was subtle at first. But the horizontal [hallways|halls] [were getting|became|were becoming] less and less level. We'd stumble on a floor that canted slightly left, or tilted [a half-degree|half a degree] up or down. The walls, too, were growing angled, some leaning outward a degree or two instead of staying neatly parallel, or bent a little bit inward at mismatched angles. It made us feel drunk. You've seen so many well-constructed hallways in your life, your brain doesn't know how to process ones that don't behave.\n\n[*Ch8SpiralHall*@spiralhall>\nWe passed through one long hall that started leaning left and kept going as we moved down its length, twisting through a full three hundred and sixty degrees. I don't mean it was actually moving: imagine holding a long strip of paper, a hand gripping each end, and rotating one wrist to twist an end around. That was the shape the hallway made. The wall tilted and became the floor as we walked, and we tromped across closed doors, the rooms beneath them echoing. Then we were walking on the ceiling, stepping over light fixtures. By the time the hall ended it had rotated all the way around, and we were back on carpet again.\n\nThat wasn't the weird part.\n\nThe helix hall had opened into a grid of rooms with open doorways and no connecting corridors. After moving through these into an exit hallway, I called for a break. We hadn't been talking much, lost in our own thoughts. I said something about the weird hallway and Niko seemed confused.\n\n“Weird how?”\n\n“Twisting all the way around like that. You think it's significant?”\n\nHe didn't know what I was talking about.\n\nI asked him to describe the path we'd taken to get here. Raising a skeptical eyebrow, he did. Everything was right except he called the part before the grid “a long, straight hallway.”\n\n“Nothing unusual about it?”\n\nHe blinked. “No, not that I saw. What are you getting at?”\n\n“You don't remember, like, walking on the ceiling.”\n\nHe frowned. “Are you fucking with me?”\n\nI closed my eyes. I could remember the awkwardness of walking against that steepening angle, shifting a foot to shuffle awkward through the trough of an edge turned into two sloping floors. The way the sound had changed as the surface beneath our shoes went from carpet to drywall. The changing angle of the light as it hit us from below, from the side, from above.\n\nI told him. When I'd finished, he looked sick, and angry.\n\n“If you're messing with me, man...”\n\n“I'm not. I swear. I'm not.”\n\nHe hunched back into himself, looking despite his height like a tiny, cornered animal. Hunted.\n\n“This changes things.” His voice was small.\n\n“How do you mean?”\n\nHe sniffed. “Alters the equation, you know. If you and I can't even see the same things any more... we're lost. In every sense that matters.”\n\nWe vividly described our current surroundings to each other. Past things we'd seen: the {room shape name} room, the pool.\n\nEverything matched up.\n\nIt didn't make us feel any better.\n\n“Maybe...” I grasped for something to say. Niko was scared now, I could tell, more scared than me. He needed me to calm him down. “Maybe I imagined it. You get that sense down here sometimes, right? Like thinking's almost enough to make it real?” He eyed me, uncertain. “Maybe I was daydreaming and got confused. We've been under a lot of pressure. I mean I don't know. A mistake.”\n\nHe stared right through me. “You don't really believe that, do you?”\n\nMy face flushed. “I—”\n\n“Don't just tell me what I want to hear, Ry. Don’t ever do that. You got me? If I can't trust you...” He swallowed. My face flushed. The accusation stung.\n\n“Let's go back,” he said. “Let's go back and look, right now. Sort this out.”\n\n“No,” I said at once, instantly terrified. I didn't want to know. Because no resolution to this was good. One of us couldn't trust our senses, or both of us couldn't. Or something was much more wrong than that.\n\n{i/Or}, a voice whispered in my head, {i/maybe he's lying. Maybe he} did {i/see it, and he's just pretending he didn't.} I shook my head, but the voice persisted. {i/Who knows what else he's pretending about?}\n\nMaybe he was thinking the same thing about me.\n\n“We should go back,” Niko said, miserable. “And if we don't both see the same thing in that hall, we need to abort. Get the fuck out of here, rethink this whole thing. This is {i/fucked up}, man. We're out of our depth. We're losing control.”\n\n“We can't quit now.” I felt unaccountably calm. “If we let ourselves get spooked by every new thing that happens down here, we'll never figure out what we came down here to figure out. That's what we're looking for, right? The strange bits?” I gestured ahead. “We should see where this leads. Explore as far as we can before turning back. That was the plan, right?”\n\nHe stared yearningly back at the entrance to the grid of rooms, the path to the hallway that was or wasn't a helix. Then he turned his eyes to me. Resentful.\n\nSuspicious.\n\n“Yeah,” he said. “It was.”\n]\n\n[|Once at the peak of my swimming days I'd had a chance to swim in the ocean. It was a school trip and there was a beach day and some of the other guys were going to do it but the thought alone terrified me. Not because of waves or rip tides or sharks. In a pool, you know, through goggles, the universe becomes a smooth abstraction: white and well-lit concrete on all sides, contained, chemicals and filters flushing out anything but you. Sounds are muffled. Gravity's on break. There's no place for anything to hide, and even when you can't touch bottom, you know it's there, a few feet below.\n\nThe ocean is different in every conceivable way. Standing in the surf would be one thing, but swimming out past where my feet could touch the sand? The thought crushed me with primal terror, compressed me. An unknowable void stretching down beyond my flailing bare feet. What it might contain. Years later I tried reading Lovecraft and thought of that sensation again when he talked about cosmic horror, something so vast and inhuman it could shatter you, so close it could reach out and brush your toes. I couldn't make it through more than a couple stories. I couldn't shake that image.\n\nI couldn't shake it now.]\n\nWe kept going.\n\nThe halls branched and spread [^out] endlessly. We gave up trying to map, other than [our|the] route back. We passed through regions of dark[ness] and regions of light. The decor rarely varied from its ubiquitous blandness. Sometimes little things were wrong. [A door, off its hinges, lying neat and flat in the center of the hall.|A door turned sideways, opening outward.] [A light fixture sticking out of the carpet.|A knob embedded in the ceiling, unable to be turned.] [Crown molding running in a line a foot above the carpet.] We searched around these anomalies, but never found anything useful.\n\nSome of the rooms got larger, too big for rooms in a house. More like a school gymnasium. Still the same carpet, though. And it felt like we were seeing more of the anomalies, the farther in and deeper down we got. [An explosion of pipes and plumbing, sticking out of a wall for no particular reason|Doors or sections of hallway paved in bathroom tile]; [weird cube-shaped extrusions or cavities in the edges of rooms|rooms that were two feet wide or with fifty-foot ceilings]. It was like the deeper we went, the more flexible the rules became—of architecture, of stability, of god knows what else.\n\n[MACRO maybe you see that][@spiralhall>“You see that, right?” Niko asked, wide-eyed. I did.]\n[*Ch8HamsterWheel*@hamsterwheel>\nAt one point we came to a low-ceilinged room maybe twenty feet across, unlit, too big for our flashlights to see the far end. But at the edge of their reach, in the dimness, the floor began to curve up.\n\n{maybe you see that}\n\nWe started forward. The ceiling stayed at the same low height, maybe seven feet up, but its angle began to steepen, in lockstep with the angle of the floor. After a few minutes, the slope was too severe for our shoes to get purchase on the carpet. For as far as our flashlight beams could show the slope kept on steepening, although we couldn't see too far around the curve ahead. It was like walking up the inside of a giant carpeted hamster wheel.\n\n“This proves it,” Niko said.\n\n“Proves what?”\n\nHe threw his hands up. “Downstairs can't possibly exist.”\n\n“No shit, Sherlock.”\n\n“I mean not in real, physical space.” He swayed, shifting his balance on the awkward carpeted slope. “This is too big. We haven't gone down nearly far enough for this whole curve to fit underground.”\n\n“I don't know about that. It doesn't feel like we've climbed enough to hit ground level yet. And maybe this isn't a full wheel. Maybe it stops just up ahead.”\n\nHe scowled. “Man, why are you always {i/defending} this place? Making excuses for it? Okay, Einstein. Why wouldn't it go all the way around?”\n\n“Well, why {i/would} it?”\n\nWe stared at each other, but there was nothing else to say.\n\n“Maybe it's more like a message,” he muttered as we started back down the slope. “Rats in a cage, you know. Spinning our wheels. Getting nowhere.” He shot a vicious glance at the curving ceiling. “Funny.”\n\nThere were no doors out of the hamster wheel other than the one we'd come in from, where the slope had flattened out again. We left it behind, another baffling mystery. \n]\n\n[*Ch8StageLadder*@stageladder>\nBehind one unassuming door we found something that looked almost like a backstage, with a wood floor painted black instead of a carpet, cinderblock walls with folding chairs stacked against them by the hundreds. But no curtain, no audience, no racks of lights above. In fact there was nothing above: the walls rose up beyond the range of our flashlights.\n\nIn the exact center of the room was one of those caged metal utility ladders, climbing up into that darkness.\n\n{maybe you see that}\n\nMostly because it was going up and not down, we decided to try it. Or I decided, anyway, hands gripping the cool metal rungs before Niko could raise an objection. I felt reckless down here, brave enough to try anything. The exact opposite of the me on the surface.\n\nBesides, the ladder looked just like the one at my junior high when I'd been on stage crew. I'd climbed it a million times. The metalwork of the cage felt like a blanket. Safe.\n\nWithin a minute I'd climbed disturbingly high. I didn't look down but the beam of Niko's flashlight, trained on me, had faded to glimmers, washed out by my own. Everything around and above was dark. And {i/quiet}. All Downstairs was quiet, of course, but here it seemed monstrously so, a quiet of infinitudes, even the sounds of my own body sucked away into the emptiness around me. \n\nNiko seemed so far away.\n\n“Find anything up there?” he asked, putting a hand on my shoulder. Startled, I looked down. My hands were still gripping the rungs of the ladder, but my foot was on the floor of the stage. I was on the ground. Niko was beside me.\n\n“What happened?” I felt dizzy.\n\nHe frowned. “You climbed up for a while, then you came back down. Anything up there?”\n\nI made him try. The same thing happened. I watched him climb up, high into the darkness above. Then, without missing a beat, he reversed course and came back down. When he made it back to me he was as startled as I'd been. He felt like he'd been climbing up the whole time.\n\nWe tried experiments. Keeping in verbal contact. Focusing on our movements. With enough of that, it was possible to realize that you'd started moving down again before you'd come all the way back. But always with a sick and juddering sense of grinding gears: one part of your brain kicking in and telling another it had been looking at things wrong. It took a moment to perceive, like an optical illusion. We stopped after a particularly nauseating moment when I was listening to Niko below me chanting {i/You're coming down, you're coming down, you're coming down}, and all my senses were telling me that was wrong, that I was still climbing up, climbing up, climbing up, and when the truth crashed into my perception I felt such a wave of sickness that I almost lost my grip on the ladder, had to clutch it shivering for minutes, cold sweat breaking out all over my body. After that we decided to stop experimenting.\n]\n\nWe were getting tired. Just before turning back, though, we found one last curious room. We could hear it before we opened the door.\n\nThe room was the size of a squash court, though not quite as tall, the whole thing covered in green bathroom tile, even the inside of the door we came through. A sink rose serenely from its center. Scalding water blasted from the faucet, releasing clouds of billowing steam and filling the air with a moist, sticky warmth. The sink was full, water spilling over its sides and flowing down the porcelain like some artsy fountain, then streaming away across the tile, presumably according to some imperceptible tilt in the floor. It vanished down an open hallway, carpeted once again, slanting down at a steep angle from a corner of the room.\n\nWe walked over to the hallway to peer down. It was closer to vertical than horizontal, dropping at a vicious angle. Where the hot stream hit the tilted carpet it became black with mold, and the walls and ceiling [^of the tunnel] were stained with rust and moss. Like water had been coursing through it for a long, long time.\n\nFrom the slanting darkness rose a hot smell of rot.\n\n“This feels different,” Niko said.\n\nWe walked back to the sink and tried to turn off the faucet, but the hot and cold knobs spun loose. The scalding water rushed full force out of the tap, churning noisily in the basin.\n\n“[We're going to|Gonna] have a hell of a water bill,” I joked, but then remembered something.

But there was nothing. The billowing steam and rippling of the water meant I couldn't even see my own reflection.\n\nI got to my feet, feeling deflated.|@snakeoil>Tentative, I cupped my hands in the scalding hot water and brought a sip to my mouth.

Steep and slick. We’d need better climbing gear. And I can't see how far down it goes.”\n\nI took a deep breath. “It feels like that's the way, though. Doesn't it?”\n\nHe ran a hand through [his|steam-wilted] hair, eyes still pulled down the shaft. “[Jesus, I hope not.|Yeah. Yeah, it sure does.]”\n\n{section_break}\n\nI couldn't stop thinking about the wet tunnel as we retraced our steps. Images of it flashed through my mind. The [desire to know what was|thought of what might be] past the reach of our flashlight beams, what was down there, was maddening. I was planning how soon we could come back down, what we'd have to bring with us. What it would take to keep pushing deeper.\n\n[@spiralhall>\nFor better or worse, we ended up missing the long twisting hallway on our way back. From the grid of rooms we found a different door that let out much closer to the bottom of our pit, and decided without too much discussion to take it. I was glad Niko didn't press the point. Maybe he'd forgotten.\n\nI couldn’t stand the thought of our perceptions of the world not agreeing.\n]\n\nWe passed through the last few hallways to the base of shaft we'd come down. On the carpet directly underneath were our ropes, coiled up neat, {Grapples} still tied to the end.\n\n“God damn it,” Niko said with feeling, craning his head to glare accusingly at the shaft and fling curses up its length. We couldn't see anything unusual up there, not from down here.\n\nOur way back up had been cut off.\n\nWe had extra grapples in our packs, but the originals didn't seem damaged: just detached. The shaft was too narrow to throw one all the way back up [to the top] without hitting a wall, so we settled for hooking a doorway, halfway up.\n\nOur position now was much more precarious. We couldn't tell if the grapple was set properly: we just had to trust it. Niko volunteered to go first. From the ground below, I watched him climb, anxious.\n\n[DEFINE ^@acceptedLove]\n[@acceptedLove>And for some reason, that was the moment I finally accepted that I was still in love with him.

I was confident we'd make it back up. {pp} So I was caught completely by surprise when]\n\n[@nikofalls>{nikoFallsIntro}\nthe grappling hook ripped through the molding of the wooden doorframe far above, and Niko fell.\n\n{chapter/9}\n\nTime seemed to snap and twist back on itself in opposing directions, both too fast and too slow. Terror struck me like lightning, searing me with unbearable matching thoughts: {i/he's going to die} and {i/there's nothing I can do to help him}.\n\nThen he grabbed the edge of the next doorframe down and his body slammed against the horizontal door beneath. I watched the bottoms of his sneakers as they kicked and flailed at the smooth beige wall, scrabbling for purchase.\n\nHe was still too far up. {i/Too far.} If he fell...\n\n“Are you okay?” I shouted up at him, or something equally useless. My lungs were clenched so tight that for a minute I couldn't breathe back in.\n\nHe'd managed to press the toes of his sneakers up against the wall, but there was nothing to stand on. His position was desperate, hands gripping the inch of molding like claws. I could see muscles trembling even from here. He clung to the wall quivering like a caught-out insect, paralyzed with indecision.\n\n“You're okay.” I tried to keep my voice light, in control, willing confidence into it and up to him. My mind thrummed as it raced to find him a way out. He was still clipped on to the climbing rope but the grapple now swayed useless beneath him. The hallway pit ran featureless above and below the doorframe he clung to: there was nothing else to get a grip on, not for a dozen feet in either direction.\n\n“The door.” I projected calm authority. “You need to get the door open. If there's a room inside, it'll only be a little drop. Niko. Are you listening to me?”\n\nHe shook his head, as if snapping out of shock, found the doorknob beneath him and focused on it. It was on the bottom side of the door from our perspective, at waist-height for Niko, but too far off to the side to easily reach. \n\nHe lifted an ineffectual foot to try kicking at it, but it was too high. I watched his fingers slip towards the edge of the molding.\n\n“Nice idea.” I tried to keep my voice steady. “Just try again, okay? I'm right here. If you fall, I've got you.” But did I, really? My arms were stretched out stupidly, but if he fell into them from that height it would break us both. \n\nHe kicked again, more desperate this time, foot still far from the knob. His shoe scudded across the smooth paint of the door. His fingers gripped the molding so tight they'd gone white. He couldn't hold a grip like that much longer.\n\n“You almost had it,” I lied. “Come on, buddy, you got this.”\n\n“Just shut up for a second,” he shouted, flashing a glare down at me. “Stop fucking telling me what you think I want to hear and shut up.”\n\nI fell silent, face flushed, paralyzed. Singed. \n\nHe stared at the knob, and the silence sharpened until I couldn't help but break it, to say out loud what I knew he was thinking.\n\n“You'll have to let go with one hand.” I said it as even as I could. “Just for a second. To turn the knob.” I breathed. “There's no other way.”\n\nHe nodded. I stood helpless below him, arms still stretched up, aching.\n\nThen he did it.\n\nIn one quick move he pressed his body in toward the door, letting his toes take as much weight as they could, let go of the frame with his left hand and thrust it out hard toward the knob. He brushed it and for a horrible moment it looked like he wouldn't be able to grip it and turn it, the angle all wrong, and so was his balance, now; but then his fingers wrapped around the knob, his wrist twisted and it turned.\n\nThe door clunked and swung inwards from the bottom as his weight pushed against it, and he half-collapsed, half-scrambled through as his balance was lost, fingers slipping off the frame. He tumbled inside, banging knees and shins, and fell through, the door swinging shut behind him like a cat flap, muffled thumps and curses making their way through the walls. \n\nBut before I could even breathe out, a shock of awful, sawtoothed sound smacked into me from above, and I was so startled I bit my tongue. It was utterly alien, a juddering metallic {i/twang} that lingered in the air, throbbing, jittery, reluctant to die away.\n\nAnd then I realized what it was.\n\nThe sound turned in an instant from monstrous to mundane. Niko must have thwacked it as he tumbled past, flailing: one of those springy metal doorstoppers, no doubt surprised to meet a falling body instead of a hastily opened door.\n\n{section_break}\n\nWe made it to the top, in the end. It took a series of shorter climbs to each sideways room, treating them like miniature base camps, places to rest before flinging the grapple up another dozen feet to the next door, the next cube of safety; testing each set of the grapple more thoroughly, belaying each other as best we could in the patently unsafe circumstances. But at length, we'd made it back out.\n\n“Sorry about earlier. What I said.” I'd just grabbed his hand pulling me up the last few feet, and now we were sprawled on the carpet, mercifully horizontal again, like two mountaineers on the world's blandest summit.\n\n“Don't worry about it. You just... do that sometimes, and it bugs me.” {i/Tell him what I think he wants to hear.} I shut my eyes. “I wish you'd...” He lifted a hand, gestured vaguely in the air, dropped it in defeat. “Whatever, forget it. There's a million more important things to worry about.”\n\n|\n\nHe was a good climber. He made it to the sideways door without incident. From there, it was a matter of taking things in stages to get back up to the top. Each of the vertical rooms we passed served as a miniature base camp, a place to rest before flinging the grapple another few dozen feet to the next doorway. We'd both climb up and do it again. Eventually we made it back to the top. It was like a mountaineering expedition, kind of, except inside a house. So not at all, I suppose.\n]\n\n\nThe camcorder was where we'd left it, sitting on the carpet pointed at the pit.\n\nThe door frame where [@nikofalls>our original|the] grapples had been attached wasn't damaged. We'd seated them pretty firmly, so this suggested that rather than being yanked free from below, someone had carefully unhooked them from up here.\n\nOf course, the ropes had also been neatly coiled at the bottom. Someone had to have done that from down there.\n\n[I didn't want to watch the tape, not while we were still Downstairs. But Niko, face grim, insisted.

To our dismay, the ropes were going over the edge right to the end; whatever happened, it had been after the tape ran out. Niko held down the rewind button and we settled in for a long haul[@tapeTooShort>: but after only a few seconds we saw ourselves spring back up from the pit in fast motion, first me and then him; dicker with the grapples and rope for a few minutes; then zip over to the camera to turn it on.\n\n“I swear the tape was at the beginning,” Niko said. “There should have been two hours of space. This is like five minutes at most. What the hell?”\n\nHe let go of the rewind button and let the tape play.|. We spooled back through the whole tape, but nothing changed: it was two hours of motionless footage of the hallway and our ropes. Finally we saw ourselves spring back up from the pit at high speed, first me and then him; dicker with the grapples and rope, then zip over to the camera to turn it on. The tape clunked to a stop.\n\nCursing up a blue streak, Niko hit play.]\nWe watched in numb frustration as everything we'd done earlier played back: the same discussions about rope and seating the grapples, the same lame jokes failing to ease tension. There wasn't much point to watching it all unfold again. We just didn't know what else to do.\n\nOn the tiny screen, I was standing a pace or two back, wondering aloud how much [stuff|gear] we should take down with us. I hated how my voice sounded on tape, how my face looked. I always had. Even on the tiny screen I could see red blotches. On the screen a miniature Niko sat on the edge of the pit, adjusting his ropes.\n\nDistorted by the shitty camcorder speaker, he said, “How far down do you think this goes?”\n\nMy image shrugged, said “We [should|could] possibly go [much|far] deeper.”\n\nMy skin crawled. “Oh my god.”\n\nNiko glanced at me. “What?”\n\n“That's not what I said.” My head was spinning. What {i/had} I said? Something like {i/It can't possibly go much deeper}, maybe. Not that. \n\nScreen-Niko said “[You're|Yes,] right. [In fact|Actually], we shouldn't [you and I|the two of us] come back [^up] this [way|route] at all. [^No.] We should [go down|descend|go deeper] and we should let's stay down[^ there], down and deep.” His voice sounded strained, but he pulled his rope tight smartly. “[Don't|And don't] come back [up] [till|until] we find it, [man|Ry|friend]. What it is we [need|ought] to find.”\n\nWhere it gripped the camcorder, Niko's hand was pale. “I didn't say that either,” he breathed. “I mean I said something about that long, some of those words and phrases maybe. But they're {i/different they're fucking different—}”\n\nI shushed him, because the voices on the tape were speaking again. But now the words were familiar, mundane. We both watched the screen, afraid to blink, but nothing else seemed changed. Everything played out as we remembered. Except now every word and gesture caused a spike of uncertainty. {i/Had} I said that, exactly that? Had I moved my arm that way, stood in precisely that spot?\n\n[Screen-|Video ]Niko started to rappel. The camera focused on my legs as I stood up top, watching him descend. On the screen I waited, then clipped onto the rope once he'd made it to the bottom. \n\n[Video |Screen-]Ryan checked his harness, took a deep breath, and started down.\n\nHe paused before his head dropped out of frame to call down to Niko: “Coming down.” I remembered saying that[, I thought].\n\nThen he turned and looked straight at the camera.\n\nStraight into the lens.\n\nHe held the gaze for a long moment.\n\nThen [^he ]glanced, deliberate, down the shaft.

[^(Also, because I thought I heard someone up there, rummaging in the kitchen. The housemates were all supposed to be at a party. “Hello?” I'd called, but no one answered. The noises stopped, though.)] We were becoming trolls, hiding from sounds, afraid to go out under the sky, only venturing from our cave to get more supplies, stock up for further ventures down.

Jumping at our own shadows.” He [@convopit>leaned back against the carpeted wall|lay back down on his sleeping bag], staring up at the ceiling.\n\n[@gorilla>I remembered something from a neurobiology class. “Did you know there are more neurons going from your brain to your eyes than in the other direction?”\n\n“So?”\n\n“From your brain to your eyes,” I repeated, “not the other way around.”\n\nHe blinked. “That doesn't make sense.”\n\n“It does if you realize that vision is mostly the brain telling the eyes what it expects them to see.” I rubbed my face again, trying to wipe off the exhaustion. “We think we have two little cameras in our head. We don't. They're little yes-men, reassuring us nothing unexpected is happening. That's why that trick works, with the guy in the gorilla suit. You ever see that video in school?”\n\nHe nodded. “You're watching a bunch of people toss a ball around, and the guy in the gorilla suit walks right through them, and it's like he's invisible. He even waves. But you don't see him the first time, because you're watching the ball. Then you watch it again looking for him and your mind's blown.” He smiled faintly. “Dude in my high school science class swore the teacher changed the tape.”\n\n“You don't see the gorilla because you don't expect to. There's no reason he'd be there, so your eyes don't notice him. Even though he's in plain sight. Standing right in front of you.”\n\n|@cdrom>“There was this weird CD-ROM game I was playing,” I said after a while. “It doesn't exist over here, I guess. You spent all your time wandering around listening to these crazy scientists rant and banging your head against bizarre alien puzzles. I couldn't make any goddamn sense of it.” I pulled my knees up to my chin. “But I keep thinking about it. Maybe even more, now that I can't actually play. I'm turning the pieces I have over and over, trying to fit them together, figure it out. But I can't. I'm missing something, and it's probably not even something I can find. It's locked on a CD in another universe. So it's pointless, but I can't stop obsessing over it. Just endless frustration, with no way to ever make progress.”\n\n“Yeah, dude, that's how I feel about all those games. Especially {i/Return to Zork}.”\n\n“But that's the thing,” I said, earnest. “They all feel like that until you see the solution. The clue you walked past ten times without noticing. The right spot to stand at, the right place to click. Once you find it, everything pops into place. It's plain as day and you can't believe you didn't see it before.”]\n\nWe were both quiet for a while.\n\n“So maybe we're somehow looking at this wrong,” I finally said. “We're not seeing something. We keep saying it doesn't make any sense. Maybe we're just not seeing it the right way.”\n\n“Maybe.” He closed his eyes. “Or maybe there's nothing there to see.”\n\n[\n“Niko. About the accident.” I swallowed. “That night.”\n\nHe rolled over. “Don't want to talk about it.”\n\n“I know. But if you ever did want to, I mean, if you ever needed that again—”\n\n“I don't. Go the fuck to sleep, man.”\n\nWe both closed our eyes and tried.\n|\n“Niko.” I swallowed. “You think our doubles are the same as us? Like, exactly the same?”\n\n“Obviously not,” he said, rolling over. “{different notes}.”\n\n“That's what I mean.” My stomach felt unsettled. I was on the verge of saying something dangerous. He felt it too. I could tell just from looking at the back of his head. “Little differences. Other versions of us. Of everything. Where there's no three dollar bill. Who knows. Maybe there's versions where both of us, where one of us...”\n\n“Go to bed, man. We need to get some fucking sleep.”\n\nWe both closed our eyes and tried.\n|\nI closed my eyes too, and tried to sleep. But\n] I could feel the camcorder dream lingering, eager to take over again. I tried to fight it off, but I was so tired.\n\n[MACRO different notes][@fridgetrapped>Different notes, different video|They found different things.

I hadn't been to class in weeks, which didn't help, but everything I'd learned earlier had vanished from my brain, neurons reclaimed, I supposed, for more important things. Then I started hallucinating, questions and pencil marks multiplying and layering on themselves even when I looked up from the test, abstractions filling the darkened auditorium, and I had to flee, whispering a hurried apology to the T.A. that I was having a medical emergency.|I got fired from my job, which was fair enough; I'd missed two shifts in the past week.

[80>I stood outside the closed door, {bloodorpencil1}, listening. It sounded like an elephant. Heavy, clopping footfalls made the floorboards groan. Wet, agitated breathing rasped. Dust motes danced at my feet in a strange breeze, sucked under and pushed back out through the space below the closed door, rhythmic. Air moved with faint fleshy sounds, like a hundred quiet people flapping their arms, flailing.\n\nI crept away, miserable, and by the time I came back with Niko and he threw open the door in some play at courage, there was nothing there.\n\n{nikos arms}|20>\n\nNiko was out---I didn't know where---and I'd trudged up the creaking stairs to my room {bloodorpencil2}. My bedroom was mostly a waystation now, a point to pass through on our way to the Big Room underneath with its piles of junk and remnants of police tape and my sleeping bag under the foosball table. I could sleep upstairs but my head always throbbed up there, and anyway Downstairs was cool and dark and quiet and all I wanted just then was to zip myself into a nylon cocoon and wait for Niko to get back. \n\nSo as I reached for the doorknob outside my room, I was thinking of nothing but Downstairs, and that's when I heard the floorboards creak inside.\n\nI froze. Maybe it was Niko, heading down or coming up. I tried to think of something funny to say, a way to surprise him.\n\nThen I heard the sounds.\n\nThey were like moth wings, but heavier, fleshier. Flailing, flapping sounds, like a hundred children thrashing their arms around, smacking against each other, mid-seizure.\n\nSomething was breathing, too. \n\nIt was heavy, tortured, huge: the breath of a sick elephant, a dying titan. The floorboards groaned again as if something massive had taken a step, shifted its weight. The wood flexed beneath my feet.\n\nI looked down. Dust danced on the scuffed hardwood in a strange breeze, sucked under and pushed back out through the gap below the closed door, rhythmic. Each mote sparkled in the dim, distant light, except where the shadow of my legs made them invisible.\n\nThe shadow of my legs. The light was coming from behind me, from the hall. \n\nWhatever was inside could see I was standing here.\n\nIt {i/spoke}. \n\nThe sound was distorted, clipped, like a hundred recordings of voices thrown together unmixed, maxing out the dynamic range of reality. It was scream and cry and laughter and words and grunting and hum and song and cough all scraping against each other like geologic faults, painful and unsteady. Unwillingly I remembered how the history lady had looked, thought of the sound something like that might make if it knew what was happening to it, if it wasn't just an optical illusion but, god, an event, a trauma; thought of the copies of {who was in hall} I'd seen in the dim hallway that first night we went Downstairs and wondered what it would be like if there were a hundred of them all squeezed together in the space where only one should be, each trying to escape and become its own person; wondered whether this was all in my head or whether it mattered if it was; wondered if it mattered that all those voices, those screams and cries and giggles and moans, were all, unmistakably, my own.\n\nI turned and ran. I half-twisted my ankle on the stairs, cracked my wrist against the banister with enough force to leave a bruise I wouldn't notice till much later, but I didn't stop. And as I tore open our front door to flee I crashed straight into Niko, coming in.\n\n{nikos arms}\n\nEventually I led him upstairs, terrified to go back but also to let him go alone, like he'd offered to in some misplaced stab at courage. But there was nothing in my room. He'd thrown open the door brandishing a hockey stick but everything was exactly as I'd left it, nothing out of place, no cracked floorboards or lingering smell of death or signs of anything unusual at all. \n\nHe gave no sign of disbelieving me, and I loved him even more for that.\n]\n[MACRO who was in hall][@justRyan>myself|@justNiko>Niko|@ryanAndNiko>ourselves]\n\n\n[MACRO nikos arms][~I collapsed into his arms, sobbing, and he let me stay there for a while until I'd calmed down.

Gone between one blink and the next.]\n\nHe had a perpetual headache now. He kept describing it with the word “[stabbing|piercing|throbbing]” and only that word, as if clinging to the sound of it. Like using a different one would acknowledge the pain too had changed, grown worse, was no longer caged by the word he'd picked to trap it. I could see how much it hurt him to think, to make words, to move around. He ground his teeth. [@nikoblackout>He stood up carefully now, putting a hand against the wall each time, as if his blood was fighting his heart’s attempts to lift it to his head, to keep it from being dragged back down.|He was being worn down.]\n\n[DEFINE ^@ch9weI]\nMy headaches [weren't getting worse, not yet anyway|were getting worse, too, but it wasn't the pain that bothered me].

It might have made more sense to [leave|start|go down|do it] after a good night's rest, but neither of us could sleep, and spending so much time down there meant night and day were becoming academic concepts anyway. Niko caffeined up (I was jittery enough already), and we loaded our packs with canned food and power bars, thick gloves, and crampons from the sporting goods store. “12 points of contact ensures solid grip on ice,” the box had said. We didn't expect the manufacturer had tested them on [slime-covered|moldy] carpet, but it was the best we could do.\n\nIn my pack was also a gun. [I bought it from a place I’d driven past every day on my way to work but never gone into until that morning. The friendly clerk agreed to waive the mandatory waiting period in exchange for the last of my ATM cash.|It had been my dad's. I hadn't wanted it but I couldn't throw it away, nor could I make myself go to the safety courses mom had signed me up for, or take it out from its box at the bottom of my closet with other things I didn't want to look at. But I hadn't forgotten I had it.] I didn't tell Niko about the gun. I thought it would make me feel safer but it just felt heavy.\n\nIt had been a hot day and the old house clung to that heat through the night with grim brick desperation. Descending into chillier air was a relief. With every step down the headaches diminished, our mood improved. It was almost addictive, being down there.\n\nWe retraced our route through the upper halls to the top of the shaft and reset the grapples. This time Niko hammered them into the doorjamb, face set, until he'd driven the steel spikes three inches into the wood. Even so, neither of us really expected they'd still be there when we got back.\n\nWhen, or if.\n\nGetting down was a familiar exercise now, danger mitigated by procedure and repetition. We retraced our route to the tiled room with the sink[@spiralhall> via the shortcut we'd found]. The water was still running, hot and steaming, rushing across the floor to the corner with its angled hallway lined with slimy black carpet. We shined our lights down the hot throat and the steam grabbed their brightness, bounced it back to us [maliciously|innocently]. We couldn't see more than a few body lengths down.\n\nNiko ran a hand through his curls, deflating again in the hot moist air; scratched the hair behind his ear furiously, like a dog with an itch. [^He was shaking.] “Are we sure about this? Really really? Because it sort of seems like a colossally stupid thing to do.”\n\n“You have a better idea?”\n\n[^“No. Is that what lemmings say to each other, you think? Before jumping?”\n\n“The lemming thing is a myth.” I shrugged out of my pack and unzippered it, digging for gear. “Walt Disney made it up because a bunch of wiggling rats made for boring footage. Good story, though, isn't it?”]\n\nHe sighed, looking down the steaming shaft unhappily.\n\n“No, I don't have a better idea,” he said at last.\n\nWe pulled on the crampons and the heavy gloves. Harness, rope, knots. Check. Niko pounded two new {Grapples} into either side of the angled tunnel entrance. We tied on. Double-check. \n\nThen, each holding our rope, kicking hard to sink the sharp toes of the crampons deep into the slimy carpet, we started down.\n\nIt was slow, hot work. Once we got inside the slanted hall, the steam was oppressive, everywhere: we were instantly drenched with it, like rot-smelling sweat. Even with the crampons our feet slipped. The sludge was deep and slick, a stew of algae and mold and fungal slimes, green-black and stinking of putrefying jungle, of horrible things happening under your carpet, inside your walls. We held tight to the ropes with steam-wet gloves. The walls and floor twisted and bent as we descended, as if the constant moisture had warped them, but the downward angle stayed [relentless|vicious|relentlessly vicious].\n\nIt was a gullet. We were letting ourselves be swallowed. No---worse. We were forcing ourselves in. Eager. Like we couldn't wait to be digested.\n\nWe were nearing the end of our sixty meter ropes when everything went to shit.\n\nAll at once we were sliding. Our ropes had gone slack in our hands, no longer connected to anything. There was no time to dig in the crampons; we were already moving too fast, careening down like a grotesque slalom. Neither of us screamed, focused I guess on trying to grab hold of something, anything, but there were no doorways, no light fixtures, nothing but the thick hot slime and the scalding water. I tried to dig my feet into the oozing carpet but my loose rope had entangled me, my pack was in my way, my face was smeared with scalding gunk and I couldn't open my eyes.\n\nMy hand closed on Niko's leg and I grabbed it. A moment later the floor angle shifted and he cried out, threw his body sideways, brought us both to a shuddering, squelchy stop.\n\nWe were soaked through, overheating. Scalding water ran past us down the slope. I blinked my eyes open and saw he'd wedged himself into a kink in the tunnel. One of his knees was scraped open and a dull red mark on his forehead was beginning to swell. But he'd done it. He'd stopped us.\n\nRopes slithered down the tunnel past us, followed moments later by two grapples still tied to their ends. Niko reached out to grab one with his free hand, but his weight shifted, and he had to throw the hand back against a wall to re-brace, cursing. I tried to snag them with my foot, but didn't even come close. They vanished down the tunnel, trailing rope.\n\nNiko's face was tight. He tilted his head down toward me. “This was a mistake. God, we're so fucking stupid. Ryan, man. We have to go back.”\n\n“[Calm down|Hang on],” I gasped, head filled with the roaring of the water, blinking gunk from my eyes. “Don't panic. We can do this.”\n\n“Man, I'm barely holding on. I don't know how much longer I can keep from slipping. We have to try to climb back up.”\n\n“Back?” I said, confused. “You want to go back?”\n\nHe stared down at me. “Of course back. Are you fucking crazy? Where the fuck else?”\n\n“There’s nothing good up there. Nothing right.” I kicked my foot for purchase, managed to rest at least some weight on a hidden protuberance. “Besides, nothing's changed. The plan's still the same.[^ This is the best lead for finding a way back to our side.]”\n\n“Are you not paying attention?” he hissed, furious. “Something is trying to kill us.”\n\n“So let's [find|figure] out how to stop it.” I tried to keep my tone reasonable. “We're halfway down already. Climbing back up will be [hard|rough], regardless. Why not get all the way to the bottom first?”\n\n“Because we don't even know if there is a bottom.” His face was blotched red with fury, with sweat, with the scorching heat of the air. “Halfway? We have no fucking idea how deep this goes. I should have said this a long time ago. You're obsessed. You get obsessed a lot, man, let it drag you down. Your stupid records.” He took a deep breath. “Well now you're obsessed with this place, and it's blinding you. It's {i/feeding} on you, your obsessions. Multiplying them. You can't see it, or maybe you don't want to, but I do. I'm looking right at it. [@gorilla>Like the gorilla in the crowd.|@cdrom>Like the answer to the puzzle.]”\n\nI was angry. “If I'm obsessed with anything, it's with finding a way back. We're running out of time. We either figure this out, or we're stuck here forever, [on the wrong side|in the wrong world|in the wrong universe]. We need each other to get through this.” [I said it again, like saying it could make it true. “We need each other.”]\n\n“You're obsessed with me, too,” he muttered. “When was the last time you hung out with someone else?”\n\n“When was the last time you did?”\n\nHe shook his head angrily, dismissing this.\n\n“Our housemates,” I pushed, “when was the last time you hung out with any of them? Anyone other than me?” He stared back, seething. “Their names. I bet you can’t even remember their names.” I was bluffing. But could I remember them, either? Names, faces. No. There was nothing. None of those people mattered, not to me, not to us. We were the only thing that mattered. Getting back to where we’d been, what we’d had. What I’d wanted. \n\nHe shook his head again, violent, like there was something inside it he wanted to dislodge. “You’re living in a fantasy,” he spat, “you always have been. {i/I can’t be what you want me to be, okay?} I can’t be what anyone fucking wants me to be. You all have these versions of me in your head, these ideal perfect Nikos, but they’re not real. [They're not real.] I can’t live up to them.” He opened his eyes, stared yearningly back up the shaft. “Help me. If you really care about me, help me back up. Don’t be like everyone else. Don’t just fucking {i/use} me to get what you want.”\n\n“Going back's not going to help. There's no answers up there.” He wasn't understanding. I reached for something else. “Those headaches aren't going away. You think you can live with that pain? Forever?”\n\n“Better than being fucking dead!” He seemed to realize I wasn't changing my mind, turned away to reach for a handhold, but there was nothing there, nothing to grip, and he scrabbled pathetically at the slime.\n\n“Is it?” I shouted, angry, desperate. I had to say something, something that would make him stay, keep him here, and my mouth raced ahead of me. “You won’t make it, up there, not with pain like that. We both know you won't.”\n\nHe tensed, glared down at me. “What the fuck is that supposed to mean?”\n\n“You know exactly what it means,” I said, shaking. “Never really helped you. I've done nothing but help you. I've always been there for you. Every fucking time you fall I pick you back up. {i/You’d be dead if it weren’t for me.}”\n\nHe shot me with a gaze of such cold fury I cringed. “You're fucking poison,” he hissed, “you know that? A fucking snake. I wish you'd let me die that night. I wish we'd never met. {i/Let go of me!}”\n\nAnd his hand did close on something, and he pulled himself up, triumphant. His leg was slipping out of my hands, and I couldn't bear for him to crawl away from me, [couldn't stand it,] couldn't handle the thought of going back up to that world, to any world where everything was wrong and nothing I wanted was possible, so I pulled. I pulled, too hard, and both his hands slipped, and he crashed back into me, only I wasn't holding onto anything but him any more so both of us tumbled down, faster and faster, slipping and twisting and scraping together down the steepening blood-hot slope, down and down and down into darkness. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

[@dadphone>And all I can think of in this moment is Bradley, this cute sweet transfer student who a month before had found out I also liked weird old music, so he corners me after band one day to talk about it. He loves old music, strange music, making weird cross-genre mix tapes, and he plays some for me out of the half-dozen he keeps in his backpack, which is also filled with loose-leaf sheets of staff paper scribbled with notes because oh, he also composes, too, and he’s impossibly cute and I’m so flustered, embarrassed, because as obvious as his interest seems now, back then it’s not even possible for me to consider it. I never once think that he might be like me because I've never met anyone like me. We spend hours in the practice room and make plans to hang out again and then the next day in the hall some kid from the varsity team shoves him to the ground, hard, sends his books flying. Calls him a faggot. I’m paralyzed, half a hallway away, frozen while I watch Bradley say something from the ground, a denial, maybe, and the jock is saying something back, evidence, maybe, but I can’t hear because my pulse is pounding in my ears. I’m too afraid or ashamed to go help him, to say anything at all, risk the ugly spotlight of the jock’s face turning on me, too, because he’s clearly making a thing of this, drawing a line. Not in our school. I imagine a chalk outline around Bradley, red graffiti. A queer died here. I can’t move, not even when he finishes collecting his things, gets up, and walks away, taunts at his back, walks down the hall towards me, and now I can move but only to turn away, face flushed and heart galloping, and I can’t look at him and I don’t know if he sees me there as he passes by. But he isn’t at school the next day and the week after I hear he’s transferred somewhere else, and I never see him again. And now in the dark closet as this dumb girl’s lips push against mine all I can think is that it should have been Bradley, my first kiss should have been him, and now|@bradphone>And all I can think of in this moment is all the guys this could have been, friends I'd been too shy to get close to, guys from the showers or the seat across from me in homeroom, even guys who brushed past me in the hall with a glance and made me crazy for the rest of the day. Three months later I'd meet Bradley and have a real first kiss and all would be forgotten, brushed aside in favor of a thousand better kisses, remembered still despite the awful way they ended. But now in the closet as this dumb girl's lips push against mine all I can think of is what's been taken from me, the legend of my first kiss, how] I’ve fucked it up, lost it, failed [@dadphone>him|some future boy] and myself and even this girl, whose eyes I can’t meet [@dadphone>either] as I pull away and brush past her out of the closet and past snickering faces to the door outside, changed, maybe, or maybe not. Her hair was in the way, after all, long straight blonde strands of it tasting like strawberry conditioner, so our lips didn’t really even touch, let alone tongues. Was that a kiss? Did it count? Who knows. I don’t feel like it should, and anyway I don’t feel any different except maybe worse, somewhere deep down, even less experienced and less ready and less sure of who I’m supposed to be. I drop out of band not long after that. I’ve always liked listening to music more than playing it, anyway, and I like to listen alone.\n\n\n\n{section_break}\n\nI plunged into a pool of steaming hot water, instantly immersed, choking. My scrabbling [hand found something slimy but solid and pushed against it. My|hands could find nothing to push against but churning water, and for a few awful seconds I panicked, thrashing; and then my] face broke the surface and I gasped, slipping and struggling to my feet. Water came up to my waist. I wiped rank muck off my face, blinked burning eyes open, tried to catch my breath.\n\nIt was utterly dark. All I could hear was splashing water.\n\n“Niko?” I shouted.\n\nNothing.\n\nI shrugged off my pack, zipped it open with blind, shaking fingers while struggling to keep it above the waterline, and fumbled around inside. My hand closed on a plastic tube. Glowstick. I pulled it out and snapped it, shook it, frantic.\n\n# First light.\nA dim {color1} glow began to bring the world back, a breath at a time. Churning water was everywhere, white and frothy. Steam swayed. [A few steps away a sheer angled shaft climbed back up|Above my head a sheer shaft opened up and angled away], lined in oozing black gunk and coursing fluid. The one we'd slid down, presumably. Turning all the way around, the edges of my dim circle of light suggested level hallways, flooded, leading off into darkness in three [equidistant] directions.\n\nNo sign of Niko.\n\n[Something dark and coiling swirled in the water: my rope. I grabbed for it and reeled it in. One end was still attached to my waist. At the end of the other, my shiny grappling hook trailed tangled green streamers. \n\nI searched the frothing surface, but saw no sign of a second grapple, or a second rope.]\n\nShutting my eyes, I tried to sort through the confusion of the sliding fall. We had tumbled, together at first, my hands grabbing for his slime-drenched shirt, the sodden edges of his pack. But there was nothing to get a grip on. After those first few moments all I could feel was my own tangled rope, the pasty mulch sliding past me. I assumed I'd gotten ahead of him, or behind.\n\nBut what if I hadn't? What if he'd managed to stop himself again behind me, wedged himself into another kink in the tunnel?\n\nOr what if the tunnel had split, somewhere up there?\n\nI didn't want to think about the third possibility, but I spent a few grim minutes duck-walking through the water, old rescue swim lessons running through my head, feeling my hands through the muck beneath the churning surface. I found nothing solid. No backpack, no rope. No body.\n\nHe wasn't here. I was alone.\n\n[{section_break}]\n\nEverything in my pack was soaked. I threw out a waterlogged sandwich and watched it drift in the churning current before vanishing beneath the foam, as if someone hungry underneath had grabbed it. I'd lost a crampon in the fall and couldn't find it, so I took off the other one and maneuvered it into my pack. The {color1} light from the glowstick turned everything the same shades. {color1shades}\n\n[DEFINE 33>@gunsignal]\nI had no idea if the dripping gun would still work, [@gunsignal>|and was seized by a thick fear now of firing it down here---of how far that sound would carry and what it might attract---]but I slipped it into my belt anyway. It still didn’t make me feel safe but I tried to pretend it did.\n\nMy flashlight wouldn't turn on, even with fresh batteries. “Water resistant,” according to the package, but I imagined it had been subjected to an environment outside factory test conditions. I strapped it to the top of my pack anyway, hoping it might dry out and be useful again. I had a dozen waterproof glowsticks, so I wasn't [immediately worried about light.\n\n{i/But a countdown's started, hasn't it? Tick, tock, tick.}|really worried about light.{pp}Not yet, anyway.]\n\nI stared up the shaft we'd tumbled down for a long time, considering. Climbing back up---without a rope, with only one crampon, without someone helping me---seemed impossible. I tried to picture Niko up there somewhere, struggling to pull himself back up, handhold by slippery handhold. If he made it to the top, he'd throw another rope down to me.\n\nWouldn't he?\n\nI waited a long time, as long as I could stand it. It might have only been a few hours, maybe even less. But it grew more and more maddening to simply stand there, soaked through, bathed in steam and sweat, doing nothing. Wondering if he was trying to find me. Wondering if he'd left me behind. Wondering if he was drowning or dead or lost, somewhere in this [irrational] maze.\n\n[I thought about what he'd said to me, what I’d said to him. But I couldn't get a grip on it. The words kept slipping away. I couldn’t process them. Not then.]\n\nAt last I decided to move. If he'd made it back up, he could take care of himself. And if he was down here somewhere, maybe I could find him. [Offer help, if he needed it. If he'd take it.] Anyway hadn't I said it would be silly to make it all the way here and not explore?\n\nIt was the deepest we'd been yet. Maybe there were answers down here. Or at least another way out.\n\nI picked a flooded hallway, took out my keys and gouged a crude arrow into the shitty paint of the wall, drywall dust spilling out. Breadcrumbs, to find my way back. Or show Niko where I'd gone, if he was lost down here too, or came looking for me.\n\n{i/And if something else comes looking, you're pointing it right at you.}\n\nBut there was nothing to be done about that. I gave the shaft back up one last doleful look, then turned to the hallway and began to push my way forward through the hot, sluggish water.\n\n{section_break}\n\nI wandered. I'm not sure for how long. The black water's surface smoothed once I moved away from the turbulence at the bottom of the shaft, swallowed up the glowstick's dim {color1} light. There were no longer any curious features or unusual architecture: only an irregular grid of junctions. The infrequent side rooms [@furnished>were either empty or filled with rotting furniture floating on the surface, waterlogged, ruined|were always empty]. Sometimes the floor or ceiling sloped up or down, not always in sync; so the water level would drift from ankle-deep to above my waist, and the ceiling from claustrophically low to beyond the reach of my light. The halls trended wider and narrower, too, in unpredictable rhythms. I worried for a while about stepping into a pit I couldn't see and dunking myself again, but there weren't any. Nor were there stairs, up or down, or even light fixtures. Only hallways, branching, recombining, endless.\n\nThe air stayed steamy, and while the water cooled as I moved farther from the hot inlet stream it was still uncomfortably warm. I felt hot and clammy, thick-headed. Mist swirled in the air, sculpting the dim {color1} light into strange shapes and shadows.\n\n[@gunsignal>It was while stopped to dig through my pack for a fresh glowstick that I thought of using the gun as a signal.\n\nIt had kept intruding on my thoughts like a sore tooth as I trudged the flooded halls, chafing against my waist. I pulled it out and stared at its bulk in my hand, calculating. It wasn't that big, but I imagined it still ought to make enough sound to carry quite a ways down here. If Niko was anywhere nearby, he'd hear it.\n\nGripping it with both hands, I flicked off the safety, lifted it above my head to aim at the ceiling, and pulled the trigger.\n\nThe shot was deafening, and instantly my vague hope soured to abject terror as I realized what I'd done, realized how far that sound might carry, wondered who else might hear it. The reverberations echoed, endless. {gun reverb} \n\nBut I couldn't take it back. It was done.\n\nThe echoes finally slunk away into the shadows. I waited for minutes, straining to hear an answering sound in return, either welcome or ominous. But the silence had fallen back over me like a weighted blanket, hot and smothering, and the new ringing in my ears didn't help either.\n\nI wondered if I should fire again, to give him a better chance to find me. If he'd heard the first shot, it would have caught him by surprise. This time he'd be listening, straining to hear a direction.\n\nSo would anything else.\n\n{i/Fuck it.}\n\nI shot the ceiling again, cringing from the noise and a new spike of dread---{i/and maybe Downstairs won't like being shot at}---counting the seconds till the echoes died away. I stared at the gun in my hand, too terrified to make eye contact with the black sockets of the flooded hallways. {i/Four shots left.}\n\nI waited for an hour. It was torture, standing in knee-deep bathwater turning my blood sluggish as itself, with nothing to do but wait, and worry, and listen. But I heard no answer. Nothing sounded in return. Nothing came.\n\nI gouged another arrow into the wall, and moved on. I'd decided to keep moving until I found something useful or I couldn't move any more.|I kept gouging arrows into the wall with a key, kept moving.] If I kept moving I wouldn't have to stop, wouldn't have to think. \n\nWalking takes almost no thinking at all.\n\n{section_break}\n\nI came to another spot where the hallway widened, but this was different. Running along the indentation in one wall was a row of pay phones.\n\nI slowed to a stop and stared, wondering if they were really there.\n\nThey rose from knee-deep water, six of them each on its own steel pole. The ceiling had risen so high my glowstick couldn't find it, but light stabbed down from somewhere, spotlighting each phone[ like it stood beneath its own personal streetlight,] fierce and bright after hours of flat {color1} glow.\n\nWater sloshed as I trudged over to the nearest phone, reluctant but intrigued. Pay phones don't normally live inside a house. Did that mean something?\n\nI touched the black plastic of the receiver. It felt grimy and cold. As if in a dream, I lifted it, held it to my ear.\n\nDial tone.\n\nI blinked as it droned in my ear. This didn't make sense. If there was no power this far down, surely there weren't phone lines either. Some telecom grunt hadn't run a cable all the way down here, snaking it through all these endless halls and vertical shafts, had they? Hope they billed by the hour.\n\nThe sound of the dial tone was [disturbingly|uncomfortably|unsettlingly] familiar.\n\nWithout meaning to, I reached out a finger and dialed a number from an old commercial jingle. Seven sing-song digits.\n\nA voice told me to insert fifty cents.\n\nI almost laughed at this familiar banality. I slapped my pockets, but had no change. I hadn't expected to need any.\n\nI put down the receiver, lifted it again and dialed zero, still not really expecting anything would happen. \n\n[After a ring, |A ring, and then] a woman's voice: “Operator.”\n\nMy bluff had been called. I didn't know what to say. “Er... I'd, uh, like to make a collect call.”\n\n“Please hang up, dial star nine seven, then the number you wish to call. Say your name at the first tone.”\n\n“Thanks,” I managed.\n\nShe was gone. The silence hung oppressive in her absence. I needed a voice back on that line. With a couple words she'd made the familiar loneliness unbearable.\n\nBut who could I call? Water sloshed around my knees as I considered the utter inexplicability of my situation. Should I call the police, explain I was lost in my own basement, miles from the surface? Ask the fire department to send a rescue team through my bed, down the vertical hallway, and throw a rope ladder into the slimy tube in the giant bathroom?\n\nOr maybe I'd call a friend. You know, one who'd believe me, who wouldn't hang up thirty seconds into my story. In the movies, whenever someone says “You wouldn't believe me if I told you,” there’s always someone to say back: “Try me.” This person invariably turns out to be surprisingly open-minded. \n\nI knew with grim certainty this was not going to work for me. The only friend I had like that was Niko. And he was gone.\n\nI felt desperately alone. \n\nMy fingers brushed against the dial pad, hesitating. They punched star nine seven and then kept going, tracing out a familiar pattern, a groove deep in muscle memory. My fingers knew it well.\n\nAt the first tone, I said my name.\n\nSomething clicked and whirred in the receiver. A pause, and then, a ring.\n\nAnother.\n\nAnother.\n\nSomeone picked up and said, “Hello?”\n\n“Mom.” Relief flooded through me like adrenaline. You trust a voice like that on a primitive level, instinctual, in parts of your brain deeper than logic, than thought.\n\nShe must have heard something in my tone. “Honey? What's wrong?”\n\n“What, I only call you when something's wrong?” [I tried to joke, but|But] my eyes were tearing up and my hands were trembling. I held the phone tight against my face. It smelled like old sweat and institutional cleaner.\n\nWith my other hand I wiped my forehead. Swallowed. “Nothing's wrong. Just wanted to hear your voice. How are things? Tell me what you're up to.” I didn't care what she said. I only wanted her to talk and keep on talking. To hear sounds from a normal world and pretend I was part of it. That I'd ever been part of it.\n\nShe humored me for a minute, but I could tell she was worried. And I [could think of nothing|couldn't think of anything] to say that would get me out of here.\n\n“Alright, star man,” she finally said, and my brain flashed to my sixth birthday when she dressed up like an astronaut to bring in my cake. Crêpe paper planets and glow-in-the-dark comets. “Fess up. What's going on?”\n\n“I'm... I'm in trouble, mom.” My voice was breaking. “Something's happened. You remember my... my friend Niko?” I rushed forward, babbling. “I've lost him, mom, I don't know where he is, where either of us are. I fucked things up and I don't know what to do. This is too big, all of this is too big, and I... I made a mistake, and...” I bit my lip so I'd stop talking, something pressing down hard on my chest, and gripped the phone like it was my last anchor to reality. Maybe it was.\n\nShe took a deep breath. Let it out.\n\n“Oh, honey,” she said. “Is it... is it AIDS?”\n\nOf all the things to be terrified about right then, that one was so far down the list that my brain sort of tripped over itself, downshifted straight back to first and stalled the hell out. “Oh,” I said. “Uh. What? No. No, it's not AIDS. Mom. I wouldn't tell you something like that over the phone.” I took a deep breath, and once again said something I probably shouldn't have. I said it with deadly seriousness. “It's HIV.”\n\nThere was an awful silence.\n\nThen I started giggling. I couldn't help myself. “That's not funny, Orion,” she said, but then she was laughing too, and neither of us could stop, even when she kept trying to, kept saying “Orion” again in her serious voice which just set me off more, which set her off again too. And if I could have given anything to stretch that moment out forever, I'd have done it in a heartbeat. \n\nI wiped tears from the corners of my eyes. “I'm sorry. No, it's not that. I can't really explain it. I guess I just needed to hear your voice more than anything. I'll... figure something out.”\n\n“That's my smartie.” I could picture her expression when she said this; she'd said it a lot. “You're sure it's nothing I can help with?”\n\n“I'm sure.” The {color1} monochrome of the glowstick made the pay phone into an artsy abstraction; the blackness around me sucked away all the rest of its light.\n\n“Well, you'll figure it out.[” She sounded less worried than I expected, and for some reason I took comfort in that. | You always have, even when... when there wasn't someone there to help you.” She took a deep breath. That was a big thing for her to admit.] “You know you can always ask for help when you need to. But you won't always need to. And that's okay.”\n\nTears were pushing out of my eyes again, damn it. I leaned against the booth, screwing them shut. “Thanks, mom,” I whispered.\n\n“I love you, sweetie,” she said. “Do you want to talk to [@dadphone>your father|@bradphone>Bradley]?”\n\nAnd out of everything that had happened, all the unexplained and terrifying and gut-wrenching things, nothing hit me like those words did. Sometimes words hit harder than a slap. You feel them, like ten thousand volts. They sour everything that came before, ruin everything coming after. That's how those words hit me.\n\n[@dadphone>\nBecause my father was dead.\n\n“No,” I managed in a quiet, trembling voice.\n\n“Oh, he's right here, honey, it's no trouble. Hang on.”\n|@bradphone>\n“What?” I managed, my voice small.\n\n“He was helping us shop for your sister's prom, remember? The three of us had a blast. Hang on, I'll put him on.”\n]\n\nI stood clutching the phone, unable to move, to breathe.\n\nFaint rustling sounds came over the line.\n\n[@dadphone>\n“Well hey there, son.”\n\nThis is something you probably won't understand unless you've lost a parent. You have to put things away when that happens. Something is gone and parts of you went with it, in ways that aren't always obvious. You have to accept that this person is not coming back. You may not want that to be true but it is and you can't change it, and you need to believe you can't change it, which isn't quite acceptance, but still. You do it. You put the pain from those missing pieces in a box and nail it shut and you don't forget it or accept it, not exactly, but you learn to stop thinking about it. After a while it's almost like you've buried the box, or lost it. It's gone.\n\nAnd then you hear that voice again, and you realize nothing was ever buried or lost or even nailed shut. The box has been there all along, wide open, and everything in it still has exactly the same power to hurt you. It's just been waiting for the right moment to try.\n\n“Hey, dad.”\n\nThe words came out against my will. {i/There's been a mistake}, I thought dreamily. He's still alive. Just a dream that a freight truck doing ninety smashed into him on a country highway with a busted stoplight, killing him instantly, taking him away from me between one blink and the next. It made sense: it had never felt real, anyway. Some strange multi-year delusion, not easy to explain but so, so easy to accept. \n\nOr maybe in this universe it had never happened.\n\n{i/Maybe here, he's still alive.}\n\n|@bradphone>\n\n“Hey, gorgeous.”\n\nThere are some voices you hope you'll never hear again. When a person bends you so far you snap, you can usually forget about the piece of you that broke off, until something reminds you of the splintered edge where more of you used to be. When people die or move away or betray you and you tuck your thoughts of them out of sight like a forgotten photo album, it's a shock when the book is dragged back out, the pages wrenched open, frozen moments shoved unwanted toward your face.\n\nThe stylus of a record player is a needle, dragged along a ragged surface to conjure ghosts of long-ago sounds: instruments, rhythms. Voices. If you don't consent to be played, the needle hurts.\n\n“Brad.” I didn't know what else to say.\n\n“You will not believe this dress we found for Sarah.” I could hear his mischievous smile, the sound of the glints in his eyes. His tone was light and playful and casual. Like we'd last spoken yesterday. Like nothing had ever been wrong.\n\n“Brad,” I said again, “what the fuck are you doing at my mom's house?”\n\n“Oh, you know, casing the joint,” he said breezily. “Your mom has a lot of good stuff. Is it okay if I just say ‘mom?' {i/She's} been saying My Second Son all day, so it's kind of awkward if I don't. Oh my god, Orion, does she know something I don't?”\n\n“What?” I felt weak.\n\n“This mysterious camping trip,” he teased. “Wanting everything to be perfect. Don't worry, babe, I'm good at pretending to be surprised.”\n\n“What are you talking about?” I sounded like an idiot but I couldn't help myself. Nothing made sense. This conversation was out of its groove, the needle scratching across the surface, leaving an ugly mark that could never be buffed out.\n\nHow could he act like everything was fine, after all that had happened? Like any of this was normal?\n\n{i/Maybe in this universe, it was.}\n]\n\nThis had never once occurred to me since I'd passed through to this side. It was too huge a change. All the differences were so tiny, so inconsequential. Not like this.\n\n[@bradphone>I couldn't conceive of what my life would have been like, if we'd never inscribed those wounds on each other. If we'd stayed whole. Who would I even have become? Who would he?]\n\n{i/Or.}\n\n{i/Maybe it's not him at all.}\n\nSomething inside me withdrew, to wherever small animals go in their heads while staring down looming headlights. Some residual part of me thought I ought to move, speak, react. Get out of the way. But I didn't know how.\n\n[@dadphone>“Good to hear your voice.” My dad. He sounded like he meant it. “How you holding up?”\n\n“Dad.” I wasn't in control: I sounded distant to myself, like someone else was speaking. “Dad. What's going on?”\n\nHe chuckled. “We were going to ask you the same question. Your mother and I were a little worried after that call the other day.”\n\nI couldn't think. “Call?” I said stupidly.\n\n“From you and Niko.” My father hesitated. “We couldn't figure it out, son. You want to let us in on the gag?”\n\n“Uh. Gag?”\n\n“Sure. All that business about {i/going deeper}.”\n\n|\n\n“So is this super-secret message part of the whole thing?” He still sounded playful, flirty. “All this stuff about {i/going deeper}?”\n]\n\nMy blood was frozen and my mouth had gone dry. “What?”\n\n“[@dadphone>You said|@bradphone>When you called last night],” he explained, voice still achingly familiar, “[@dadphone>you both said the next time you called, I was supposed to remind you that you have to go deeper.” He cleared his throat. “That, um.” I could hear the rustle of a paper, like he was reading off a notepad. I could see him, squinting through his glasses. “That you're not deep enough yet, and you need to keep going. Deeper and deeper. As deep as you can get.” He cleared his throat. “Pretty mysterious. What's it all about?”|@bradphone>so secretive. You said next time we talked I was supposed to remind you that you need to go deeper.” I could hear him raising his eyebrows, somehow, seductive. “I'm not opposed, dear, although maybe we shouldn't talk about this”---he dropped into a stage whisper---“when your mother's in the other room.”\n\n“I didn't talk to you yesterday.”]\n\nThe ground felt like it was dropping away.\n\n[@dadphone>“So what's the news, son?” my father said, a hint of a smile in his voice. “You in deep enough yet?”|@bradphone>“I wrote it down because it was so weird.” I could hear the rustle of a paper: I could see him, squinting through his glasses. “I'm supposed to say that you're not deep enough yet, and you need to keep going down. Deeper and deeper. As deep as you can get.” He cleared his throat meaningfully. “I mean you know I'm all for going down in general, babe, but seriously, what's the deal?”\n\n“I don't... I can't...” There were so many things I wanted to say to him. Fear and anger and a homesick longing for places that can't be returned to were churning around inside me. I couldn't accept this. I didn't know if I could even survive it.\n\n“Babe,” he said, “what's wrong? You're being weird.”\n\n“I loved you,” I whispered.\n\n“I love you, too,” he said, mishearing, and then something spasmed inside me, my lungs locking up like in a cramp, refusing to breathe. My vision closed down to a tunnel. My fingers went numb.]\n\nI dropped the phone. It swung on the end of its metal coil, spinning slowly. I could still hear his voice, faint and distorted---\n\n“Ryan?”\n\n---[@dadphone>dad's|Bradley's] voice, drifting faint from those tiny holes in the receiver, as I backed away, staring---\n\n“Orion? [You|Are you] there?”\n\n---and my shoulders hit the wall, and I couldn't back away any more but I could still hear his voice coming out of the receiver, so I pulled out my gun and shot it.\n\nSomehow I hit the dangling receiver on my first shot, and it exploded. Tiny bits of plastic shrapnel cut the air. One whizzed past my cheek and sliced it open. I didn't notice. I raised the gun to the boxy metal body of the phone and shot that, too. I shot it again and again until the gun wouldn't fire any more. \n\nMy ears hurt. The reverberations were deafening, echoing endlessly. [@gunsignal>They seemed even louder this time, like they had a life of their own. Like they'd never die out.|{gun reverb}] I unclenched my hand and the gun fell into the water, vanishing under the surface without a splash.\n\nThe phone made a distinct, metallic {i/clunk}.\n\nI looked up at its bullet-riddled surface.\n\nInside, something was tumbling down through the pay phone's innards, dinging and plinking past metal obstructions. My gaze moved down, following its invisible path through the body of the phone.\n\nFinally, the clattering stopped. The gate of the coin return jiggled as something clunked into the slot behind it. \n\nNot wanting to, I edged forward. Part of me reached out while another part tried in horror to call my hand back, but it kept moving. It pushed the gate open.\n\nIn the coin return was a small brass key. \n\nI stared at it for a long moment. Then I snatched the key and pulled back, turning away from the bank of phones in the same movement. I slogged fiercely on through the water and down the hall, moving fast, not looking back. \n\nMy ears still rang with gunshots. In the silence, that ring kept sounding almost like a distant telephone, bell clanging somewhere far behind me. I tried to ignore them, but the ghost sounds didn't fade for hours.\n\n\n[MACRO gun reverb][~I pictured compressed sound waves expanding through miles of hallways, like a dangerous thought lighting up more and more neurons, bouncing off skullbone to keep reflecting, multiplying, feeding on itself. A sound crashing up staircases and down shafts in rippling patterns of interference and reinforcement. I stared down at the gun in my hand, thoughts dull, shots ringing and echoing in my head and through the halls.]\n"

I stepped carefully past the open door and the [strong] current rushing in, tide sucking [^at] my shins like it was hungry for them, and sloshed away fast up the hall, shuddering at the thought of that black pit. You fell into that thing, God knows where you'd land.\n\nSoon after, the hall began sloping up. The carpet went from wet to [merely] damp, and then, between one step and the next, dry.\n\n# Second light\nUp ahead glimmered a tiny spark of {color2}[, and as I got closer I realized it was a|. I stumbled closer: a] night-light, plugged into an outlet at the base of the wall. Something about it whispered of lightning bugs and sleepy summer nights, and all at once I felt immensely weary. I fell to my knees when I reached the weak light and sloughed off my waterlogged pack, then curled up around the tiny pale glow as if it was a campfire. My face snuggled into the brown whorls of the carpet like the fur of some huge [friendly|indifferent] beast. I slept.\n\nMy body did, anyway. My mind kept marching.\n\nI dreamed [endless] waterlogged halls. I trudged[. I can't say I explored, because I no longer made|, not making] any attempt to mark my way or track my position. I searched for nothing, found nothing: just wandered. When I realized I was dreaming I tried to break free of the nightmare, [think of anything else,] but lucidity was slippery, fumbled away between heartbeats, and I kept losing it. I walked halls lit only by [my] flickering {color1poetic} light and thought of nothing that wasn't them.\n\nOnce, in a long, straight hall of waist-deep water that never seemed to end, the surface ahead of me shifted, swirled. \n\nSomething [was moving|moved] underneath.\n\nI stopped short, squinting, and held my glowstick high. The ripples flung its dim light back to me, bunched up and distorted. But [I could make out|it was enough to see] something person-shaped under the surface, swimming toward me.\n\nThe gun was in my hand: in this dream, I'd forgotten I lost it. Gripped by fear, I aimed it at the thing under the surface and pulled the trigger. But the shots went wide, from the angle of the water or some grim nightmare-logic. Whatever it was kept coming.\n\nI cringed back against the wall. The thing beneath the water was doing the breaststroke with smooth, efficient moves. It didn't break the surface and it never came up for air. Through the rippled distortions I could see no face.\n\nBut as it swam past, [ignoring me,] I could see it [was wearing|wore] my clothes.\n\nIt didn't slow down. I pressed my back against the wall, cold sweat prickling [on] my face, helpless to stop my head turning to watch it pass.\n\nIt swam to the end of the hall and around a corner, never stopping for breath, leaving a wake of dark whorls and eddies[ behind].\n\n{section_break}\n\nI woke with a parched, sticky mouth. My face was glued to the carpet with dried blood from where the piece of phone had cut my cheek. I tugged myself free, which reopened the [cut|wound]. Wincing, I sat up and rummaged in my waterlogged pack for something to staunch the bleeding, still half-asleep. I'd left my soaked shoes on and my feet felt like they'd swelled to twice their normal size inside them.\n\nMy glowstick had long since burnt out. The nightlight's weak {color2} glow reduced the world to a dim circle of carpet, a few feet across. And I was groggy, still shaking dream-remnants from my head. So I didn't realize until I started digging for a fresh glowstick that someone was sitting a few feet away.\n\nI gasped and leapt up, scrabbling back against the wall behind me. I could see only tennis shoes, catching the {color2edge} edge of the nightlight, and the faintest hint of a body in the shadows behind them, knees pulled up with clasping hands. Someone sitting with their back against the wall, faint {color2} glints in two eyes. Watching.\n\nI stayed there trembling for a moment, too afraid to either come closer or flee into the blackness back the way I'd come. I'd left my pack in the circle of light, between me and whoever was sitting beyond it.\n\nI realized I recognized the shoes.\n\nHesitant, I cleared my throat. “Niko?”\n\nThe face was so shadowed I could barely make it out, but I thought it smiled. “Hey, man.”\n\nThe voice was cracked, weak. But familiar. Unmistakable.\n\nI stepped back toward the light. “Shit, dude, you scared me.” He made no move to get up. “What happened to you? We got separated and I didn't know what to do. Did you [@gunsignal>hear my gunshots|find the arrows I left]? Jesus, I'm glad [you found me|you're okay].”\n\nI knelt and pulled a new glowstick from my pack, but he held up a hand.\n\n“Okay if we talk for a minute first, like this?” he said. “Been in the dark for fucking ever and that thing will murder my eyes.” He lowered the hand. “Cool?”\n\nIt was such a relief to hear his voice again I shoved the glowstick back down, along with a vague sense of unease. “Fine. So what happened?”\n\n“Rather hear what happened to you. Tell me everything.”\n\nSo I did. How I'd waited at the bottom of the shaft, explored the water-soaked hallways. I told him about the call at the bank of payphones. But I left out the part with the [@gunsignal>key. I'm not sure why. I figured there'd be plenty of chances to bring it up later, now that we were together again.|gun, because in hindsight it felt stupid, and because I remembered he didn't know about the gun, and I didn't want to mar our reunion by revealing I'd kept something from him. Something else, anyway.]\n\nHe didn't say much. The {color2} glints bobbed at times like he was nodding or cocking his head. But the darkness was fierce. All I could really make out were his shoes, and the hands clasped around his knees. In the pale {color2} of the night-light they looked skeletal, emaciated.\n\nDisquiet crept into me, rising through the floor into my feet and up my bones. I couldn't see his face. I wanted to[ see his face].\n\n“Hey,” I finally said, “this dark is kind of freaking me out. You can shield your eyes or whatever, but I've got to have some light. Okay?”\n\nHe sighed, as if resigned. “If you have to.”\n\nI reached carefully for a glowstick the same way I used to walk deliberately towards the light switch in my childhood basement, shepherding growing panic with a forced front of calm. I pulled one out, snapped it, shook it, blinked at the surge of {color3} light from mingling chemicals, and held it up, anxious, as the light crept toward him.\n\n# Third light\nThe electric {color3} was shockingly bright, and he'd winced and held up a hand to block it out. He kept it there for a long moment as I squinted, pupils squirming. Finally, almost reluctant, he dropped the hand and met my gaze, defiant.\n\n[Something was|There was something] wrong with him.\n\nHe was changed. Distorted. Something had leathered him, shrunken and withered his features, hollowed his eye sockets. At first he seemed like some poorly made [copy, face a twisted parody|caricature, face a twisted copy] of the one I knew so well. But then I started to realize what had [done this|happened] to him.\n\nTime. \n\nHe was older. Much older.\n\nI was still in the shallows of my twenties, remember. I hadn't been around long enough to see how age inscribes itself on people, crumples parents into grandparents and invalids and corpses. I hadn't seen friends lose hair and teeth and muscle tone. I hadn't loved someone long enough to find out what decades do[^ to them]. \n\nThe Niko against the wall looked twice as old as he should have been, maybe more. He was wearing different clothes, but out of his standard wardrobe: the bowling shirt with “My Name Is BONG” on the lapel. It wasn't threadbare or faded. Something bulged from the front pocket, maybe a penlight, and his pack leaned against the wall beside him.\n\nHe held my gaze, waiting. We stared at each other for a long time.\n\n[I finally broke the silence. “What happened?”|“What happened?” I finally said.]\n\nHe took a breath. Let it out. “You can see what happened.” He cleared his throat. I realized [now] he wasn't tired, or strained. His voice was just older. [He spoke in short, clipped sentences, like breathing in too deep was painful.] “So. Yeah. I'm not your Niko, man. Okay?[^ I’ve been through more. A lot more.]” \n\nI [stiffened|tensed]. “You're[ the one|...] from the other side?”\n\nHe smiled. “Ah. You still think there's just two sides. Sure, course you do.” He shook his head. “Guess that's how it seems near the surface. A pair of possibilities. Neat. But deeper down, things get more... {i/tangled}.” The word sounded heavy in his throat, dangerous.\n\n“What do you mean?” I couldn't stop staring at [him, at] his face, and I swayed with the sick feeling of recognition and strangeness, curdled together [in|by] that fierce {color3} light.\n\n“There's a lot of space down here, Orion. A lot [of possibilities. Most of them... aren't|of... possibilities. Most of them aren't] good.” His glance had drifted down the corridor, but now it snapped back to my face. “{i/My} Ryan and I, we got lost. Long time ago. Real fucking lost. [We, uh.] Never made it back.”\n\n“Your Ryan?” I looked around, panic spiking. “There's some older version of me down here too?”\n\nHe looked away. “No.”\n\nAfter a moment, I realized he wasn't going to say anything else. And then why.\n\nHis eyes flicked back to mine again, as if fascinated by them. He stared with something like hunger. At seeing my face again? At seeing anyone?\n\n“Been on my own a long time,” he said, as if explaining. “Gotten used to it.”\n\nSuddenly I couldn't accept any of this. “Your clothes.” I shook my head. “Your shoes. No. They haven't changed. They should be worn down to nothing.”\n\nHe looked away again, out into the blackness down the hall. “Like I said. Lot of possibilities.” He cracked a knuckle. “We weren't the only ones who got lost. Bumped into lots of other Nikos and Ryans down here[ over the years]. Most of them dead. Sorry to say.” He cracked another knuckle, methodical. “But the clothes are fine, man. The clothes fit great.” He forced out a barking laugh, abrupt and cold. I wondered how [many years|long] it had taken his laugh to shrivel down to that emaciated sound.\n\nHe sniffed. “You get used to it. Stealing clothes[, I mean. Stops being strange after a while.|. I mean there's no Penney's down here, so...]”\n\n“But how do you eat?” I felt angry, not the least because my skin was crawling at the thought of him grave-robbing other Nikos. Other Ryans. “If you've been down here so long, how the hell are you even alive?[ It doesn't make any sense.]”\n\nHe turned back to me again, no longer wistful but with [a] dangerous sharpness. Maybe you've heard the phrase “thousand-yard stare” and maybe you've even seen one before, but I hadn't. It {i/struck} me. I believed everything he said next, no matter how fantastic. The words were only flavoring on the truth in that stare.\n\n“There's a room,” he began, voice graveling, “not much farther down from here. Different from anything up here. Bigger. A bit bigger.” That laugh again.\n[*Ch11TheBottom*@TheCity>“Can't walk the length of one of its walls without stopping to sleep. Takes five or six sleeps to walk all the way around, keeping the outer wall to your left the whole time. Passing all the doors.” He shook his head. “Maybe a few thousand halls leading out. Most of them slanting upward. But only one goes back to the surface. The rest lead nowhere, or in circles, back to one of the other ten thousand halls.\n\nHe took a breath. “When you come into this room, though, you can tell something's different. The carpet ends. It turns to asphalt.”\n\nHe stood up so quick I cringed back, but turned to the wall and placed a hand on it. He drew his finger down, then over and around, drawing an invisible square; then drew invisible grid lines in it. “Asphalt,” he said. “City streets. City blocks. A huge grid of them. Suburban streets. Crosswalks, stop signs, you know. What you'd expect. Lawns, but they're all dead. No sun, right?”\n\nHe turned back, leaned against the wall. “And all the houses,” he said, fixing me with that stare again, “are ours.”\n\n“What?” I couldn't break his gaze.\n\nHe shrugged. “{house description} Not that I've checked them all.” He laughed again. “Did the math once. There's ten million houses. Give or take. I've been down here a long time. But not that long.\n\n“{house description 2}.\n\n“And under every one of those beds, there's another Downstairs, as big as this one. And if you can find your way down, another huge empty city with another ten million houses. Each slightly different. Each slightly different than the ten million up here. And sometimes, other Ryans and Nikos come up out of them, expecting to find the real world, with people and a sun and all. They're real fucking disappointed. Especially when they wander too far and can't find the house they came out of again.\n\n{bottom story outtro}\n|@TheBasement>“Some stairs keep going down. And if you follow them far enough, they open up into black empty spaces. No walls. But keep climbing down and you'll come, in the end, to a floor. Step off the bottom stair onto dirt, packed down. Stretching out forever in every direction, as far as your light can reach, as far as your legs can walk. The Basement.”\n\nHe grinned, grotesquely. “Endless. And empty. Bits of junk now and then, I guess. Empty hope chests, half-buried in dried mud. Broken table legs, rotten lumber. Naked dolls. But mostly just endless dark, endless quiet. Endless nothing. Except for all the other stairs.”\n\n“Other...” I swallowed. “Other stairs?”\n\n“Most of them go up,” he said. “In spirals or twisted landings or long straight flights. Through emptiness, like the way down. But eventually...” He coughed, cleared his throat. “They lead to halls again. Rooms, carpet. Downstairs. But not the same one. Because if you make it all the way back up to the top, to the house, it's different.\n\n“I mean it's our house,” he said when he saw my frown. “It's always our house. {house description}\n\n“{house description 2} you climb up through to get there.\n\n“But,” he added, “but you can't get out. You can't get out of any of them.”\n\n“What?” I couldn't break his gaze.\n\n“Bricked up,” he said. “Sealed off. Windows. Doors. Bricked up. Bricks behind the walls too. And behind the bricks. Bricks forever.” His fingers drummed against the wall. “Like dead shoots, I think, those houses. Seedlings that didn't grow, didn't ever live to poke their heads into the light. And there's a lot more dead ones than live ones. Thousands of stairs that go nowhere for each that lead back up to a real house, a real universe. Whole. So you wander too far down there in the Basement, lose the stairs you first came down from...” He shrugged.\n\n“You come across other Ryans and Nikos down there,” he added, “from time to time. Wandering. Lost the stairs they came down. Hoping to find the way back to a world with people and a sun and something that isn't this. This place. Something that isn't us. They get real fucking disappointed.\n\n{bottom story outtro} \n]\n\n[MACRO bottom story outtro][~“Sometimes I'll meet them {where do you meet them}, crying, panicked. I stay away, of course. Can't get too close, like you know, or.

Once in a while one has power, too, lit up like Christmas[@TheCity> in all that dark], and the fridge is running and cold, and there's lunchmeat and milk and leftovers inside. Unspoiled. So there's plenty to eat. Just not a lot of, you know. Ambiance.”\n\nHe stepped closer. “I heard your gunshots. That's how I found [@TheBasement>the right stair. Found] you. Don't know what you were shooting at but doesn't matter. {i/You're not lost.} Are you.” He glanced behind me, back the way I'd come. “This goes back up, doesn't it? To the surface. The real surface.” He closed his eyes. “With light and birds, and grass, and people who aren't you or me. I can't tell you...” He opened them again and I wanted to shrink back, close my eyes and pretend I'd never seen something like that in human eyes, let alone in his, that hollowness [and pain|and greed|and pain and greed] and something else, too, something worse. But I couldn't. I could only stare back, cringing.\n\n“I can't tell you,” he said more quietly, “what it would mean to me to find my way back up there. Orion. I can't stay down here any longer. I can't.”\n\n\n\n\n"

Like finding a needle in a haystack. Except this haystack went [@TheCity>down|on] forever. In the best-case scenario, he explained patiently, we'd wander until our food ran out, [^and] then with our last dregs of energy and luck find our way back up [to the surface] and out, empty-handed.\n\nHe didn't mention the worst-case scenario. \n\n[We argued.|Pacing up and down up a hallway anchored only by the {color3} beacon of the glowstick, we argued.|Decamped in a small empty side room with low ceilings and walls bulging with water damage, we argued. A single weak light bulb stuck in the center of one wall made stark shadow-men play across the other.] He insisted the smart[est] strategy was for us to retrace my steps to the base of the slide and [find a way to] climb back up. “The closer to the top, the fewer possibilities,” he said, “the fewer choices. And fewer chances of making the wrong one.” When he found out I hadn't seen my Niko since we got separated in the shaft, he grew even more convinced. “Maybe he's not down here at all. Maybe he caught himself on the way down, like you said, and he's up there now waiting for you. Worrying.” He gave up convincing me. “Or if he's not, he'll realize heading back is the smart option. I {i/know} he would, buddy.” He tapped his head. “Trust me.”\n\nI couldn't deny this plan made sense, but I felt sick. Too much was wrong. “Look. Even if I take you back up there, it won't be your world. You can't stay. If you're on the wrong side too long, you start to feel---detached.” I shuddered without meaning to. “Like it's rejecting you. Like antibodies swarming. It'll kill you.”\n\nHe shrugged. “[You|We] don't know that. I'll risk it. Anything's better than staying down here.”\n\n“It's not just that.” I felt like a coward, but desperately wanted an excuse, a reason he couldn't come back with us. “You know about that sick feeling when you're too close to a twin. That's even worse than the headaches. So say we find my Niko and get you both back to the surface. Then what? The two of you get a double on campus, move in together?”\n\n[^“No.”] He sighed, impatient. “You think I haven't thought this through, all the time I've had? You help me get back up, I'm gone. It's a big planet. I've learned how to survive. I'll never get within a hundred miles of either of you again.”\n\n“Wait a minute.” I'd had an idea. “That sick sensation, when you're too close. We can use that to find him.” He raised an eyebrow. “Okay, maybe you're right, and there's too much space [^here] to find him by dumb luck. But you've got a sixth sense for where he is. You're like a magnet we can move through that haystack, feeling for tugs. Any twinges and we steer closer, till we're close enough to do the rest by shouting.”\n\n“You're not listening to me, Orion.” He was getting angry. [He realized it, took a moment to collect himself.] “There's a lot of space down here. You have no idea how much space. You're never going to find him. You need to accept that. You'll get us both lost. And I'm {i/sick} of being lost, buddy. Fucking sick of it.”\n\nHe had an intensity my Niko never had---though maybe there'd been something like it latent in him, waiting for the right trauma to pull it out like a loose thread. It scared me. [It scared me that I'd never noticed it before.]\n\nHe was right. I didn't want to get lost down here, either. I didn't want to end up like him.\n\nBut I also wasn't willing to give up on my Niko.\n\nI dug out my keys, held them up. “Look. I've been using these to mark my way. There's no chance of getting lost. And I've got plenty of food, still. For both of us. So we keep searching. Keep marking the way. Be methodical, map it out. And if the food runs low...” My throat felt tight. “If that happens, we'll turn back. But I can't give up on him yet. I can't.”\n\nHis eyes narrowed, and I could see him weighing something behind them.\n[But then his face relaxed. A huge smile broke across it, and it was so familiar, so him, that when he threw his arms around me and squeezed me tight, I hugged him back.\n\n“Goddammit, man, you haven't changed at all. Okay.” He pulled back, still grinning, and laughed---a real laugh, the one I remembered. “Shit. Like you'd give me up without a fight. Course not. The fuck we waiting for, then?”\n\nHe hoisted his pack, started down the hall. “Come on, Ry,” he shouted back over his shoulder, “let's go find me.”|“Fine,” he said at last. “Until the food runs low. But look. Buddy.” He put a hand on my shoulder, squeezed it, tighter than I would have liked. “I've been down here a lot longer than you. These halls are deceptive.” He kept his eyes locked with mine, not looking around, like the walls would notice him if he did. “We'll look as long as we can. But if we do this, you've got to trust me. When I say it's time to turn back. We turn back.” He wasn't asking. It was an order. His eyes drilled into mine and there was something cold and grim in them, like a general leading his troops to slaughter.\n\nBut then a corner of his mouth lifted and he clapped my shoulder, dropped the hand. “That okay with you, man?” he asked, and he sounded so much like his old self it ached. \n\n“Fair enough,” I said, even though I didn't want to. It made sense, I supposed, for him to play guide. But my stomach twisted when I realized what I was agreeing to, realized the power I was ceding. Realized I'd agreed to trust someone who, in every way that mattered, I barely knew at all.]\n\n{section_break}\n\nElder Niko was obsessive about marking our way---I could[n't| hardly] blame him---so we made slow progress. But despite his initial misgivings he seemed committed now to finding his younger double. Even downright cheerful about it. \n\n[DEFINE @ch12light]\nWe slipped into something like a rhythm, despite the surreal circumstances. [@ch12light>He declined my offer of a glowstick, and didn't pull out the penlight or whatever from his shirt pocket, instead keeping close to me as I swung my light around,|He borrowed a glowstick---the penlight or whatever in his shirt pocket must have been dead---and kept up conversation as he swung it around,] peering down all the hallways we passed. Sometimes, for a moment, I'd forget it wasn't him. Then the light would catch the hard-edged crow's feet around his eyes, or he'd ask in nostalgia-tinged tones if I remembered something that happened a week or a month ago, and reality crashed back into me. I supposed from his perspective I was like a long-lost friend at a high school reunion, so as woozy as it made me feel I could understand this behavior.\n\nI thought I could, anyway.\n\n[@singular06>He unnerved me. At first I thought it was simply because of what had happened to him. But then I realized it wasn't that, not really.\n\nIt hadn't broken him. He'd survived. And I couldn't begin to imagine what he'd have to have done to himself to become a person who could do that.\n\nThe first time you turn after the werewolf bites you, it must be terrifying. But eventually it's just another month.]\n\n[@ch12light>He didn't seem to need much light. I asked about this and he shrugged, saying he spent most of his time in total darkness. Sometimes, he said, there were long stretches between lit-up rooms, between scavenged batteries or glowsticks. My skin crawled when I imagined trying to navigate this endless labyrinth by feel, never knowing when you might step into a puddle of water, a bottomless shaft. A body. I thought of him wandering these halls in utter darkness, face placid, eyes unfocused, fingers skimming the paneled wall, the only sound the scuff of sneakers on carpet. Sniffing for rot at hallway junctions. Feeling on hands and knees for corpses and their backpacks of supplies, like a blind crab scavenging for leavings at the bottom of the sea. I thought of getting so used to this that it no longer seemed awful. That it seemed perfectly normal.]\n\n[The|As the hours passed the] sense that he was keeping something from me, that something was wrong, only grew. He kept asking about the way back up: casually, like making conversation. But he wanted to know what was above the slide, [^the layout of the rooms before that, ][whether we'd come through a fridge or a sliding glass door, ][whether the junction before the long stairs down had eight doors or six or five, ][which pit exactly we'd rappelled down, ][@hamsterwheel>whether I'd found the hamster wheel,|{maybe red herring}] which branch I'd taken off the Big Room to get down here. He was trying to reconstruct the route back out. Maybe this made sense---maybe he was just curious, or hedging his bets in case we got split up, like I had with my Niko---but behind the jokes and easy laughter I sensed calculation. A front. [And I had no idea what could be behind it.|Performance.]\n[MACRO maybe red herring][whether we'd found the Lamp Room,|whether we'd found the Library Chasm,|whether I'd found the Bathtub Funnel,|]\n\nNow and then I'd ask if he'd gotten any twinges of feeling, hints we were getting close to another Niko. He'd answer right away: [Nope. Nothing. Sorry.|Sorry. Nope. Nothing.|Nothing. Nope. Sorry.] At one point, annoyed, I demanded he stop for a minute and really try. [He put on a show of being abashed, of closing his eyes and concentrating---but I could tell it was only an act. He wasn't expecting to find anyone.|He apologized with abashed sincerity, and we stood at a junction for ten long minutes while he concentrated, the wrinkles around his eyes creasing as he squeezed them closed---but when he opened them again, he shook his head. Nothing. He seemed sad but not surprised.]\n\nLike he [already] knew there was no one [there] to find.\n\n{section_break}\n\n[DEFINE @ch12ducts|@ch12pantry]\nWe'd come to a [@ch12ducts>place of endless ducts and exposed plumbing. Bulky metal curves and protrusions poked from the walls: the bones of water heaters, of central air. The ground was dry, but the room felt hot and moist, dripping all around us.|maze of endless narrow rooms and hallways lined with empty shelves of all shapes and sizes, like a fractal pantry. Stairs twisted up and down through shelf-lined landings, doors opening onto endless dead-ends lined with more shelves, stained and bent from past weight but supporting nothing.] We poked around a space the size of a mansion, cluttered with oddly-sized corners and crannies, finally realizing the whole area was a dead end. There was no other way out.\n\n“Maybe it's time to turn back,” Elder Niko said when we realized this, solemn. We were near the back of the big cluttered space[@ch12ducts>. A smell like rotting leaves wafted from the sharp metal ruins of a boiler that looked like it had ruptured from the inside. The carpet was mottled with rusty blotches, like overlapping pools of dried-up blood.|, in a long narrow dead-end with twenty-foot ceilings, flimsy shelves stretching all the way to the top. The air was dry and smelled of dust.] “Man, it's going to be hilarious when we find out my younger self's been topside this whole time. Lounging on a blanket in the backyard, you know, under the sky. Catching some rays. [^Listening to tunes.] Waiting for you to get out.” He laughed, and his voice [@ch12ducts>echoed off a thousand metal boxes|sounded hollow, swallowed up by endless rows of empty shelves].\n\nHis face grew more serious. “Or maybe he's so lost we'll never find him. Orion. I tried to tell you. This place is too big.” He gestured around us, took a deep breath, looked chagrined. “It's a lost cause, buddy. I think it's time to give it up.”\n\nHe took a step toward the door, but I was in his way, bristling. Holding my ground. \n\n[I said, “No.”]\n\nHe stopped, looking confused. “What's up?”\n\nI couldn't explain my trembling, except for a deep-seated certainty that this was wrong. Everything about it was wrong, just generally, but a specific wrong thing was the way this place had taken Niko from me and done this to him, made him into something I couldn't understand and didn't trust, and I couldn't stand [it|this stalemate] any more. Some yawning possibility loomed before me, like I was [blindfolded on a precipice, about to step forward. But I had to know. Better to fall than stay lingering on the edge.|on my knees proposing and had no idea if the answer would be yes. But I had to know. Better to get shot down than keep wondering forever.]\n\nI met his eyes. “Tell me.”\n\n“Hmm?”\n\n“Tell me whatever [it is] you're not telling me. [Tell me what's|What's] really going on. I want to know.”\n\nHe frowned. “What do you mean?”\n\n“Damn it, stop {i/pretending}. Everything is not okay. You're stringing me along and you need to stop it. Be honest with me.”\n\n“Oh?” His expression [had started to shift. Something was slipping.|stayed pleasantly neutral. I could project on it anything I wanted.]\n\n“Stop playing games.” I clenched my fists. “Stop {i/using} me. Look, we can do this together. You need me to get out of here. Both of you do. I know the way back, and I'll help you, but I need to trust you. And you need to trust me. Okay?”\n\n[He nodded, looking serious, and bowed his head. Then gave himself one final nod. As if coming to a decision. {pp} He looked up smiling, |Looking annoyed, he scratched furiously behind one ear, not meeting my eye. He sighed, heavy. {pp} Then, looking up at me with a resigned expression and shaking his head, he] stepped forward, and punched me in the throat.\n\nI staggered back, pain exploding from my neck, but he stepped forward at the same time, looking bored. He punched me in the face so hard I spun sideways and slammed into the [@ch12ducts>wall|wall of shelves], something crunching in my nose, and he kept stepping forward, grabbing my wrists and kicking my feet out from under me. He twisted my arms as I fell so I landed face first, and still he kept moving with me, descending with his knee in my back so when I hit the ground his full weight slammed down on top of me. He punched me hard in the kidney, twice, grinding my face into the carpet with his other hand now somehow on my head. \n\nMy mouth was open but I couldn't breathe, or scream or speak or think for lack of breathing. My throat felt crushed, my lungs paralyzed. Pain like a stab wound tore open my side. I couldn't think enough to move [^my] muscles. \n\nNever taking his weight off the knee digging into my spine, he pulled something from his bag. I heard a rip, and was so sure it was some part of myself it confused me when I felt no pain. Something sticky wrapped around my wrists, tugging [^at] the hairs on my forearm. Duct tape. And now I did struggle, feebly trying to dislodge him, kicking my legs. Pathetic as a half-squashed bug, twitching, not realizing it's already dead. In moments he'd bound my ankles, too, and then my knees.\n\n[^It had all taken maybe ten seconds.]\n\nI tried to make a sound, to beg him to stop, or ask why he was doing this, but all that came out was a coarse rasp, not even a gasp. So I begged with my eyes instead.\n\n[He met them and laughed. He knew what I was trying to say. It amused him.|He met my gaze, then looked away, dispassionate. He knew what I was trying to say. He didn't care.]\n\nHe frisked me: hands patting my ass, my pockets, my crotch. “Gun,” he said, impatient, “where's the gun?”\n\nI had just enough breath back to grunt a word. “[Dropped.|Gone.|Lost.]”\n\n“Stupid.” He cuffed the back of my head. “There's worse things than me down here. And worse {i/me}s.” He smirked, but his hands had found my back pocket, felt what was inside. They reached in, urgent, and dragged out the key. His breath caught.\n\nHe bent down and shoved it in my face, angrier now than he'd looked while beating the shit out of me. “What's this? How long ago did you find this?”\n\nMy head spun, trying to think of some way to regain control. “Couple,” I gasped. “Hours.”\n\n“Have you used it yet? Gone through?”\n\nI didn't want to answer his questions, but I couldn't see how lying would help me, either. I shook my head.\n\nHe stood up and [@ch12ducts>punched the wall, leaving his fist in the cracked indentation it made for a long moment|slammed his fist down on a shelf, cracking the flimsy wood]. Then he started to pace, furious. Thinking. I groaned and rolled partway onto my side. The pain in my kidney was evolving from a stabbing into a roiling burning sickness, like something inside me boiled, threatened to burst. Breathing felt like forcing air through pipes sealed with rust.\n\n“My Niko,” I rasped. “Looking for me. Won't let you. Do this.”\n\n“Your Niko's dead,” he said, and he said it so simply, so matter-of-fact, it sunk into me like another punch. “Found him and got rid of him before I found you. I always kill the Nikos first. Makes the headaches go away faster.”\n\nIt felt like the room was dropping[^, like he'd cut some elevator cable I hadn't known was holding me up]. I didn't want to believe him. I fought not to. “No,” I gasped. “Bull. Shit.”\n\nHe reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out what I'd thought was a penlight. It wasn't. It was a finger.\n\nHe tossed it onto the carpet by my face and it rolled once, coming stiffly to rest a few inches from my eye. It was cut through at the knuckle and pale and dead. But more or less the right color. \n\n“I've killed him hundreds of times,” he said, sounding bored again. He was watching me, though, and as he noticed my tears he gave them a small, sad smile, as if touched by my naiveté. “And you, too, you little bitch. You're even easier. Always freeze up at first. Or if you don't, you try to grab my arm. But the same way every time, right? So that makes it simple to break your wrist. When you double over whining, it's easy to grab your skull and smash it into the ground until you stop moving.”\n\nHe knelt down, turning his head sideways to study my face, as if curious about the effect his words were having on me. “This time's different, though. {i/You're} not lost yet. {i/You} know the way back.” He reached out and tousled my hair, playful-rough. “And you're going to take me there, Orion. Take me back up. Or you're going to die.”\n\nHe stood up again. “But this fucking key. Complicates things. You said you're on the wrong side, from your perspective. Yeah?” I didn't answer; he went on as if I had. “That means there's another you who's also found a key. The twin key to this one, on the twin side. And if that other you didn't get ambushed by his old bestie”---a wicked grin---“he'll pop through to this side soon enough. Because. You find a key, you're [^almost certainly only|just] a few hours away from finding its door.”\n\nI couldn't see how this changed things. “Why does that m-matter?”\n\nHe turned the key over and over in his hand, staring at it. “Staying in sync. Wasn't that always our theory?[^” It was like he was asking the key. “| ]I think we have to. Buddy. I told a lie earlier. I don't always kill you both right away. Sometimes I... ask questions.” He scraped a thumbnail along the key. “Find out where you've been. What happened before. The ones who have it worst are always the ones who got too out of sync. With their doubles. [@fridgetunnel>There's lots of connection points but the higher-up they are, the easier to get---misaligned. Two lasers pointing at each other, yeah? Nudge them just a bit, and instead of meeting, the beams go on forever.” I thought of the tunnel with the infinite fridge, and shuddered. “And if two sides lose sync|And if they lose it] entirely... if things warp too out of true...” He made a sucking sound through his teeth, bringing it to a crescendo and then cutting it off, like a tire popping in reverse. \n\nHe glanced at me, then back to the key. “That's what happened to me. My double and I, we... diverged. And something tore. Or popped, maybe. [@fridgetunnel>Forget lasers.] Think pairs of soap bubbles, floating in infinite void. They need each other to stay stable. Our universes got too far apart and it wasn't good for them. They're gone now, or too far to ever reach. Dark.\n\n“But yours...” He grinned even more broadly. “A ripe pair. Undamaged. Still connected. To each other, and to you. You. I can follow you back into them like a thread. Like a fucking thread, Orion. Up and out and back [and] into the light.”\n\nThis is the part where if I was a spy or an action hero, I'd be secretly digging a knife out of my pocket, working my way free of the bonds, taking advantage of the villain's distracted ranting to try for my freedom. But I wasn't a spy. I was a Bio major. I'd never been in a fight. I was trussed up, I couldn't move, the pain was still excruciating, and I had no idea what to do.\n\nAs if to reinforce my stupid squandered opportunity, Niko seemed to notice me again. Abruptly he put the key in his pocket (his front right pocket, I noticed, desperate not to be completely helpless) and dug through my pack. With a satisfied grunt, he pulled out rope, and proceeded to tie my hands and lower arms behind my back, so tight my elbows almost touched. \n\nMy freedom was slipping away. I tried to keep him talking. “But...” I had to clear my throat, heavy. “[If you... if|If] [Niko's dead---my Niko---isn't|my Niko's dead, isn't] it too late? How can anything be in sync now?”\n\nHe paid no attention to this, continuing his rope work. When [he was done|he'd finished] he wrapped the end a few times around my neck and fear spiked through me, but then he [grabbed under my arms and] lifted me gently to a sitting position, leaning against the wall.\n\nHe went to the pack and pulled out my flashlight, shaking it. “This thing work?” I didn't answer: he was already toggling the switch on and off with no effect. He grunted, dug some batteries from his own pack and slipped them in, nodding in satisfaction as the light came on. Pocketing it, he rummaged through my pack, eyes lighting up when he found my cache of food. He ripped open the wrapper on a power bar and took a huge bite, grunting in satisfaction. [^Ignoring me.]\n\n“Niko,” I said, trying not to cry. “Please let me go.”\n\nHe grimaced, like what I'd said had hurt him, and scooted closer to me, still chewing. He [grabbed my chin and forced up my head|touched his fingers to my chin and lifted my head, gentle|grabbed my hair and pulled back my head|ran his fingers gently through my hair, tugged back my head]. Stared into my eyes with a frown. Like he'd lost something in them.\n\n“I told another [little fib|lie] earlier, bud,” he said, swallowing. “[@TheCity>Sometimes those houses down there|Sometimes those dead and bricked-up houses] do have power, like I said. Who knows why or where it comes from, but sometimes they do.”\n\nI kept my eyes on his, hoping to find some empathy or humanity there.\n\nHe took another bite. Chewed more slowly this time.\n\nThere was nothing in his eyes.\n\n“Power,” he said, mouth half-full, “[but the fridges and pantries, in all those houses?|cold fridges. Sometimes. But nothing inside.] They're empty. All of them. There's no food [@TheCity>down there|down here], [Orion|buddy]. None at all.”\n\nI [was|couldn't stop] trembling. I couldn't look away from his eyes.\n\nHe swallowed again, shoved the last of the bar into his mouth. [Still gripping me with his other hand, he turned my head from side to side, like he was admiring it.] “But you and me,” he said, mouth full, “other versions. Man, there's {i/so many} of us. Popping up [@TheCity>out of those houses, those millions of houses|or tripping down those stairs, those millions of stairs]. Lost. Always lost. Pathetic. Eaten all their food. Starving, out of their minds. They're already dead, really. Or a nudge away.”\n\nHe swallowed the last of the power bar, licked his lips and the crumbs off his fingers. Then he leaned forward, slow, like he was going in for a kiss.\n\nHe stopped, face inches from mine.\n\n“Wouldn't it be such a waste?” [^He spoke quietly, carefully.] His breath smelled of processed figs. “Such a shame for all those deaths to have been for nothing. To have served no purpose. Don't you think?”\n\n“Niko,” I begged, wanting it to mean so many things.\n\n[He touched a finger to|His finger touched] my lips. “I think you get it. So. We have to find the door this key connects to. [^Yeah?] We have to wait for your doubles to come through---yours, and your dead friend's. Swap places with them. Pass back to your side. Keep things {i/synchronous}. And then head up, up, up into the shallows, back to the surface, away from this place forever, and synchronicity can go fuck itself.” He stood up, reaching down, and grabbed my shirt to jerk me to my feet. He wrapped the end of the rope around his arm.\n\n“But we'd better get moving. Cause your door's going to be farther down from here. And best for both of us if we [get to the surface|find it] before I get too fucking hungry.” He gestured back toward the way out of the jumbled [@ch12ducts>room of metal tubes|maze of shelves], mockingly polite. “After you, amigo.” \n\n\n\n"

He'd cut the duct tape from my ankles so I could walk, but tied a blindfold made from a damp shirt tight around my face. “Little handicap,” he said, “case you decide to [run|wander] off.” I cringed [as|when] he clapped me playfully on the back. “Don't worry[, bud]. If you're good, I'll tell you when you're about to walk into a pit.”\n\n[@ch13open1>Like a bitter parody of the exploring I'd done with my Niko, a million years ago, we searched.|We searched.] At intersections he'd describe each hallway, and casually discuss which way to go, as if we were equals. As if he hadn't threatened to kill me and worse. Other than a preference for moving toward anything weird or different, he seemed content to let me choose the direction. He marked the wall, tracing our path with fastidious care---“If we're doing it on this side, they're doing it on theirs, too”---and on the whole seemed downright cheerful. For a while he whistled something I finally placed as the theme to one of our favorite shows. Just the second bar, over and over again.\n\nLike he'd forgotten the rest.\n\n[75>I made little plans for how to get away.\n\nNone of them seemed very plausible.]\n\nFrom his descriptions, I gathered we were passing through a maze of identical drab halls. The carpet underfoot was sometimes dry, sometimes thick with something that felt like dead mulch and made me stumble, and often slick with slime and mold. We must have been only just above the water table, if such a concept made sense down here. Probably it didn't. Sometimes we'd go up dry stairs to a soaked hall at the top, or along a downward slant that went from squelchy to dusty. We were near water, anyway, moving through histories of past inundation. Niko described walls streaked with damage from it, paint browned and peeling. [Once he found some mushrooms growing from a split baseboard, and stopped to eat them. I could hear him chewing, a slimy sound. The smell as they mixed with his saliva was of pond scum and rotting dirt. He offered me one, but I declined, and he seemed unsurprised. He said they'd keep you alive but weren't especially satisfying. I tried not to hear menace in that.|More than once he had to direct me around collapsed sections of floor, sinkholes I could sense only through the hot smells of rot wafting up from them, the uneven edges of torn carpet and cracked cement at their lips. Hands on my shoulders, he told me where to step. I obeyed.|]\n\nThere were few side rooms here, but he'd open the door to each we passed and check it. Bedroom-sized, he told me, [@empty>all empty except for a small drain in the center of each floor.|sometimes empty, sometimes filled with chaotic mounds of furniture in broken, ruined pieces. A small drain in the center of each floor, sometimes clogged with sawdust, splinters, and grime, leaving stagnant puddles of mold-choked sludge.]\n\nIt was hard to keep my balance, blindfolded and with arms bound behind me, and I stumbled a lot. The adrenaline from earlier had worn off, leaving behind a dozen throbbing aches and a deep exhaustion. How long had I been down here? I couldn't come up with a number, but my body knew the answer. Too long.\n\n[Worse, I felt abysmally alone. To feel like the last person in the universe that cares for you is not only gone, but twisted into a thing that loathes you with active and pulsing hate, is utterly miserable. Maybe this place had twisted him, or maybe that hate had been there all along, buried under the surface, and I’d just never noticed it.]\n\nAt the next intersection I tripped on a rough patch of carpet and collapsed, smacking my chin against the ground. It hurt, and I started crying. Sobbing, actually. I'd never felt more useless, pathetic. Niko told me to shut up, and I tried to pull myself together. He sighed, and suggested we take a rest. Sniffling, I agreed. \n\nHe sat me up against a wall[ and fed me a power bar, one torn-off piece at a time]. I clenched and unclenched my tingling hands; from the elbows down everything was numb. After a while the tears stopped.\n\nI wanted to sleep but couldn't bear waking back up to this. I wanted him to untie me, unwind the rope from my neck, let me go. I wanted to get away from him, or better yet for none of this to ever have happened at all. I wanted to be dreaming of something other than hallways, and him.\n\nI could have none of these things. But he hadn't gagged me. I could still talk. And maybe talking together, like we'd done so much, I could find a way to reach him.\n\nSo I asked him about the things he'd seen, and he told me.\n\n[@furnished>He spoke of a room whose floor was a chaos of school desks, plastic bucket seats and flip-down wooden tops. How he’d excavated them out at least ten feet deep without seeing signs of a floor.|{maybe infinite floorboards}] [@stageladder>He spoke of corridors whose floors and ceilings began to steepen in either direction, rising up to the vertical, gigantic carpeted wheels serving no rational purpose.|He spoke of caged metal ladders climbing up through vast, dark, empty spaces, rung after rung through nothing but void.]\n# We've used this bit a few times, so only use it here if we haven't seen those.\n[MACRO maybe infinite floorboards][@fridgetrapped>{mif2}|{mif backup}]\n[MACRO mif2][@TheCity>He spoke of rooms where the carpet was worn, could be ripped up to reveal floorboards underneath. He spoke of ripping up those floorboards to find more floorboards, of excavating down ten feet with no sign the boards ever stopped.|{mif backup}]\n[MACRO mif backup][~He spoke of a hallway twelve miles long without a single door or turn. Of a huge labyrinth of circular halls he'd mapped, pressing towards the center, until at last he'd arrived triumphant in the small circular room at its core. All that was there was {center of labyrinth}.][MACRO center of labyrinth][a single unworn tennis shoe|a bent and broke bike wheel|an empty filing cabinet, slowly rusting away|a crushed plastic laundry basket with nothing inside|a muddy speaker from an old stereo, half-embedded in dirt floor|a pile of crumbling bricks, like the reward for the maze had never been built]\n\nHe spoke of more connection points between paired dimensions, useless to him since he couldn't find his way to the surface of any---and all {i/tangled} down there, he said again. The connections always had some kind of airtight seal. [Steam-filled wood saunas with a door at each end|Garages with electric doors on either side|Walk-in closets with snug doors on either end]; [lobbies with revolving entryways|empty gun safes with doors on either end, just large enough to wriggle through|school lockers just big enough to stand in with doors on each end]; a shower, but vertically stretched, thirty feet of bathroom tile with frosted glass doors at the top and bottom, and climbing its steel fixtures, faucets and knobs sticking out at random from the walls, climbing it all the way to the top[@originalniko>| in absolute darkness. Because that was another universal feature of the connections, apparently. Your light, whatever its origin, would go out in the space between, like my flashlight in the fridge. He'd taken a burning two-by-four into one and as soon as the door shut behind him the flames simply stopped, not even glowing embers left behind].\n\n[Sometimes {nice room furnished bit} were part of a regular house. Out the door you could pretend there was a kitchen, maybe, with bacon frying and morning light slanting through the window, or a porch with a cool breeze. As long as you stayed put it was almost like being home. He said these rooms, by far, were the most dangerous of all.]\n[MACRO nice room furnished bit][@furnished>you found rooms so well-furnished, he said, you could almost imagine they|there were furnished rooms, he said, that you could almost imagine]\n\nHe spoke of [catwalks over voids|curving tunnels made from scraps of sandpaper and carpet samples|dunes of rolling carpet], of [flooded libraries swimming with illegible books|attics that stretched on forever|ladder bridges over Niagras of scalding water], of [a maze of closet the size of a city block, endless cramped turns ducking under dusty coat hangers|treacherous mountains of abandoned silverware, poised to bury you alive at the slightest touch|hallways with vanishing points worked into their architecture, growing smaller and smaller until you couldn't wedge yourself forward any further, coming to a point some impossible-to-judge distance ahead]. [{maybe unused ch7 bit}] He spoke of vast caves made entirely of stairs: walls, floor and ceiling expanding and contracting in carpeted, ninety-degree edges. [More than a decade later, the first time I saw a blocky cavern descending into shadow in {i/Minecraft}, I had to shut the game down, right then, turn on the lights, walk away. It looked exactly how I'd imagined Niko's stair-edged pits.|Of pits with barely-heard voices rising from their invisible depths, and the things the voices said if you listened long enough.]\n[MACRO maybe unused ch7 bit][@empty>A maze of tunnels made from furniture, like a children's dream of a couch fort brought to life, that he'd been lost in for a week.|A maze of crawlways through half-sized doors, like the ones you see opening onto water heaters or the electric meter, that he'd gotten lost in for a week.]\n\nFinally, he trailed off, and we steeped together for a while in the thick, unbroken quiet. I was trying to think what I could say to keep him talking, but he broke the silence first.\n\n“You would have gone wild for some of that shit, man. Wish you could have been there.” His voice was wistful. “All our crazy, stupid theories. We were wrong about everything. But it was more fun being wrong together.”\n\nI licked my lips. Maybe this was my chance.\n\n“Yeah. Hell yeah,” I started. “Jesus, man, I can't imagine what it's been like for you.” {i/Isn't the phrase “I can only imagine?”} some part of my brain whispered. I shook it off. “I mean, I don't know what I'd have done, if it were me. Alone down here.” I took a breath, extemporizing. “You've... done things to survive, and I mean who could blame you? Who's to say when push comes to shove what's right or wrong when survival's at stake?”\n\nHe didn't make a sound, and I couldn't see his face through the blindfold. But I sensed a tide shifting. I'd said something wrong. My chance was slipping away.\n\n“{i/You don't have to do this to me.}” I hadn't meant to say it and not with such pitiful desperation, but now I couldn't help myself, couldn't stop babbling. “We're friends. You're my friend. We're only going to survive by working together. You don't have to keep me tied up like this. I want the same thing you want. To get out, get the fuck out of here---”\n\n“Friends.” he interrupted, voice dangerously quiet. “Is that what we were? Back in the day?”\n\nMy chest was tight. “[Yeah. I thought so. ]Weren't we?”\n\nI heard a scratching sound. A dog itching itself. I couldn't see but had a clear image: he was scratching the hair behind his ear, head tilted, half-turned down. Something he always did right before explaining something he didn't think he should have to explain.\n\n“I've had a lot of time to think, Ry.” His voice was still calm. “About our {i/friendship}. About {i/us}.” I jerked: he'd rested his fist on the top of my shoe. “Why we ended up down here.”\n\nI was losing him, or had already lost him, but I didn't know how or why or what I could say to reverse it. “Yeah?”\n\n“Yeah,” he said, lifting the fist and letting it fall back on my sneaker. “I think maybe there was more going on than I really appreciated at the time. For. Example.” He punctuated each word with a harder bap on my foot. “We only found this place because of you. Remember? Because you found it, underneath your bed.”\n\n“Okay,” I said, “but---”\n\n[“And {i/that} only happened,” he said, hitting my foot harder, “because we were both living in that house. And why was I in that house, friend? Why did I end up moving in?”\n\n“You just said it. We were friends.” But something ugly was burrowing up. I shoved it down. “I mean maybe it's my fault you were there, sure, but I didn't mean to… I mean I couldn't have known… you needed a room, and so---”\n\n“I needed a room, and you wanted to help me out. Is that it?” This time he punched my foot, hard: it ached through the shoe. “Why me, Ryan? {i/Why. Specifically. Me.}”\n\n“We were friends,” I said again, like a mantra that could save us. I was cringing back, eyes clenched shut behind the blindfold.\n\n“That's not it,” he said, but then |He shushed me, and] I sensed him stiffen, twist his head away. He switched on the flashlight and dim light filtered through the blindfold. He seemed to be pointing it down the hallway, back the way we had come.\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“Shut up. Did you hear anything?”\n\nI shook my head, [vague] distant relief mingling with fresher fear. “No.”\n\nSilence. It seemed to expand in my head, like those disposable earplugs, eating up all the empty space.\n\nFinally he turned back toward me. “I think something's following us.”\n\nSome{i/thing}. Not someone. Oh. “Like what?”\n\n“You know about the other versions of us down here.” He snickered. “More than you'd like to. The doubles, and their doubles from the other houses, and so on. They're us, more or less exactly. Which is why we get that sick feeling when they're close. And because they're us exactly, it makes them easy to take out. Don't have to learn their weaknesses, because fuck, you already know them.” He paused for a moment. “But there's... other ones.”\n\nI wasn't sure I wanted to prod, but found myself doing it anyway. “Other ones?”\n\nHe shook his head. “Ever see someone watching you down here? Like at the edge of your light?”\n\n“No,” I said, hair rising. “I mean... I don't think so.”\n\n“If you get closer, you can see they look like us, too. Always a Niko or an Orion. On the outside, anyway.” The pattern of light shifted as he swung it down each of the other hallways, then back to the first again. “When you get close to a double of yourself, you can feel it. Right? Feels wrong, somehow. Bad. Something to do with the synchronicity, I think, the risk. If the two of you see each other get out of sync, if you understand you’ve broken it… bad news, and your body senses it. That danger.\n\n“But. These other things. You get close to one of them, even if it looks like you, you don't feel anything at all. And that somehow makes it so much worse.” He spat. “Because it means the {double things} aren't human. They look like us, but they're not, not really. They're something else.”\n\n\n[DEFINE 15>@lookieloos|8>@huskmen|3>@husks|7>@ringers|7>@dittomen|6>@mimeos|6>@mimickers|6>@shamfriends|5>@mockups|5>@mockeries|5>@caricatures|4>@alterboys|6>@semblances|6>@creepermen|3>@inchmen|4>@shapes|2>@lingerers|1>@lingermen|1>@likenesses]\n[MACRO double things][@singular05>Entities|{dtactual}]\n[MACRO dtactual][@lookieloos>Lookie-Loos|@huskmen>Husk-Men|@husks>Husks|@ringers>Ringers|@dittomen>Ditto-Men|@mimeos>Mimeos|@mimickers>Mimickers|@shamfriends>Sham-Friends|@mockups>Mockups|@mockeries>Mockeries|@caricatures>Caricatures|@alterboys>Alter-Boys|@semblances>Semblances|@creepermen>Creeper-Men|@inchmen>Inch-Men|@shapes>Shapes|@lingerers>Lingerers|@lingermen>Linger-Men|@likenesses>Likenesses]\n# Runner-ups: Dupe-Things, Glommers, Gawkers, Vestiges, Mimeo-Men, Reprints, Run-Offs, Terricatures, Malingerites\n\n“You named them the fucking {double things}?” I was horrified. “Thanks. Not creepy at all.”\n\nHe laughed a genuine laugh, then cut it short, like he was upset with himself. Like I was pulling something over on him. “They {i/are} creepy, dumbshit. They just stand there. They don't usually come too close, but if you walk up to them, they don't move away. They don't move at all. They watch you.” He sniffed. “I mean they move their eyes, you know. To track you. Their heads. They breathe.” He unscrewed the water bottle and took a swig. “But they don't respond to anything you do. {i/Anything.}”\n\nHe paused, as if to let that sink in. Or as if remembering something.\n\n“And if you walk off,” he continued, “they'll follow you. At a distance. But if you stay in one place for too long, sometimes. Sometimes. They kind of creep up on you. Slow. Edge a tiny bit forward every now and then. Like they're eager, but also real, real patient. I woke up one time and two of them, two Nikos, were bent over me. Standing there for fuck knows how long while I slept. Staring. Mona Lisa smiles.”\n\nHe shrugged. “If you sprint for a while, take some twists and turns, you can shake them. Creepy, yeah, but not a problem.”\n\n{i/Oh well that's fine then.} “What are they?”\n\n“No idea.” He laughed that hollow bark-laugh again. “Maybe echoes, or waves, or something. Waves and particles. Superimpositions. This whole place, Downstairs, it's like some kind of huge multiplier. You've figured that out, right? At least that much? It multiplies. Dimensions, people. Rooms. Ideas. Emotions. Some kind of chain reaction that got started somehow, sometime. There's a spring down here,” and he was almost chanting now, murmuring, his voice gone strange, “clear waters at the source. Deep. All the water comes from there. Very, very deep. It splits, and splits, and splits again, and keeps splitting. Thousands of times. Millions. And each stream is as big as the one it's splitting from, and they shouldn't all fit but they do, and it's wrong, it can't fit in your head, it's too big {i/it's too big...}”\n\nHe seemed to catch himself, stiffened.\n\n“But the {double things},” he said, in control again. “They do it too, sometimes. There'll be two of them, moving almost in sync. Or four. I think if two bump into each other, they sort of stick together, cluster up. And if those two meet others, they all join up, like a fucking molecule. Snarled in bigger and bigger tangles.” He was watching me now, I guessed; I got the sense he was smirking, enjoying the effect the story was having on me. [75>“One time I had to walk through a whole room full of them. All just standing there, packed shoulder to shoulder as I shoved my way through. They weren't doing anything. Just looking. Looking at me.”]\n\nI turned my head nervously in the direction of the hallway I couldn't see. “And you think there's one back there now?”\n\n“Oh, I know there is,” he said. “It's standing right there, watching you.”\n\nI jolted back, lost my balance, and topped over, kicking back with my feet and scrambling to right myself. My skin was crawling and all I wanted was to get farther away, except I couldn't see it, couldn't see anything, and {i/what if a second one is coming up behind me---}\n\nBut Niko was laughing now, [big belly laughs,] and it slowly dawned on me through my terror what that probably meant. \n\n“You fucking pussy.” He climbed to his feet, grunting. “Dumb of me. If you'd wet your pants I'd have to smell it the rest of the way.”\n\nI awkwardly struggled upright, stood, furious. He made no move to help.\n\nBut I knew him too well. He might have been bluffing at the end, but only to cover for being legitimately scared. He {i/had} heard something down the hall, or thought he had. And he hadn't been teasing when he'd started talking.\n\nAt least some of that had been true.\n\nHe tugged on the rope around my neck. “Storytime's over, bitch. Get moving.”\n\n{section_break}\n\nWalking blind into the unknown isn't fun, and gets worse when you're freshly terrified of it. I kept expecting now to walk into a body, someone standing in my way, fleshy and warm and inhuman. Staring. But I didn't. To my captor's credit, he never let me walk into a wall (or a pit), although he was sometimes rough with jerks to the rope around my neck to correct me. \n\nBut I was reaching the limits of my endurance. My collapse by the nightlight felt like eons ago, and maybe I'd only slept for an hour or two there, anyway. Waves of emotion had washed through me since then, each one leaving its own high-water mark. I stumbled even over level ground. I was barely awake.\n\nNiko finally noticed, and agreed we could stop for “a sleep.” He let me lie down, but kept my head covered and hands tied. It was better than nothing.\n\nIt's a testament to the depth of my exhaustion that I fell asleep within moments. This time, I didn't dream.\n\nI blinked awake some time later, not quite sure what had woken me. Niko breathed quietly, a few feet away. I got the sense he was sitting up against the wall, legs folded up, and I was lying at his feet in the center of the hall. It was dark. He must have turned the flashlight off, not that I'd be able to see much anyway with a t-shirt tied around my face.\n\nI wondered if I could, very slowly and quietly, wriggle away. Like a worm out of a tackle box.\n\nHe reached out and nudged me with his foot. “Don't even think about it, bitch.” But the nudge was gentle, and his voice tired.\n\nWe stayed there for a long moment, listening to each other breathe.\n\nFinally, he exhaled, loud, frustrated. “You think I want this?” He sounded desperate. Near tears. “I don't. Any of it. Scaring you like this. I'm not a monster, man, I don't get off on it. I'm doing what I have to. You don't get that, I know, but you haven't been down here long enough. Nowhere near long enough.”\n\nI stayed quiet, afraid to say something that might make him angry again.\n\nHe sighed. “I don't always kill you, either. Or at least not right away. Sometimes, first. For old times’ sake, you know. I fuck you.”\n\nThe word {i/fuck} stung me.\n\nHe leaned forward, holding his head a foot above mine. His breath tickled the fabric at my ear. “You do remember, don't you? The time we did it?” He sounded concerned. “That night, after I tried to kill myself?”\n\nSometimes when a person is stung their body overreacts. They swell up, maybe so much their eyes are forced shut. It's called anaphylaxis. Unprotected, in the Greek. But the point is it's not the sting that's doing it to you, not really. It's your own body, blinding you and destroying itself in a misguided attempt to keep you safe.\n\n“[Yes|No],” I whispered.\n\n“That was maybe the closest I ever felt to anyone.” His voice was calm, bland, like recounting a decent lunch he'd had. “I loved you so much. Not in that way, you know. Not the way you wanted me to. But I figured what the fuck. You saved me. No, not just that.” His finger brushed my cheek through the fabric and I flinched. “You {i/needed} me. I was {i/everything} to you. That felt so fucking good.”\n\nI was trying to stay motionless. I remembered a safety video they'd made us watch at Yellowstone. {i/If you're on the ground and a bear attacks you, curl into a ball and play dead. Don't fight back. The bear will win.}\n\n#“I tried to escape you so many times,” I said. “But you wouldn't let me go.”\n\nI couldn't open my eyes, couldn't breathe. Maybe it was the anaphylaxis. Something somewhere was terrifying. Doppelgangers lurking in basement hallways. A camper in a tent, terrified by his own snores.\n\n{i/The bear will win.}\n\nHis hand moved over the shirt wrapped around my head, not quite touching it, not quite pulling away. “I want to get that feeling back sometimes, you know? It's so fucking lonely here. You can't blame me.” He laughed, so loud and close to my face I cringed. “I mean. Don't get me wrong. I'd prefer a girl but there aren't any down here. Just us. Only us.”\n\nHis fingers outlined my face. “Anyway. Doesn't work. Never works. Never the same with you.” He breathed out through his nostrils and it tickled the fabric by my cheek. “I can't trust you. Any of these versions of you. Ry, Ryan, Orion. You seem different but you're all the same. Everything you ever said or did after that. Was bullshit. None of you gave a shit about me, did you? What I needed. Who I was. You just wanted it to happen again. \n\n“And the next time I tried to off myself, that's the only reason you stopped me, isn't it?” He rapped his knuckles on my forehead, through the shirt. “Isn't it, bitch.”\n\n“No.” It was so soft, I'm not even sure he heard me.\n\nI could feel him shrug. “Anyway, that's why I kill you, after. Case you were wondering.”\n\nHe sat back up, wincing. “But sorry, man, not tonight. Got a headache.” He stood, kicked me in the side. “Come on. Better keep moving. We're close. I can feel it.”\n\n\n\n\n\n"

First it went glossy-smooth, then to shag, then to changing patterns and textures of creaking wood, tile, and carpet. I stumbled more and more over bumps and irregularities, as if the floor was crumpling, bunching up as we neared some pressure point.\n\nNiko opened every door we passed now. At the third one after we slowed down, he sucked in a sharp breath.\n\n“Definitely on the right track. You're gonna need eyes for this, kiddo.” He pulled my blindfold free.\n\nI blinked in the sudden glare from his light. He stood between me and the open doorway at the end of the hall. It was dark inside[@ffthewalls> and cold damp air spilled out; |, though] I could see something [@ffchandelier>glittering in the gloom behind him. Ice?|piled up jumbled in the gloom behind him. Bricks?]\n\n“Take a look,” he said with a grin. “I'll shine the light. But don't lean too far in. I wouldn't bet your life on my grip on the rope.”\n\nWondering what he meant, I shuffled to the doorframe. He turned and shined the light past me, and that's when the vertigo hit.\n\n[@ffdropoff>The door opened onto nothing. Past the frame, the floor dropped away into blackness. The flashlight only went so far, of course, so I shouldn't have been able to tell how far down the drop-off went.\n\nExcept I could.\n\nFar, far below us were tiny clusters of lights. Irregularly spaced, but stretching out in all directions. Maybe miles down. It was like the view out the window of a red-eye, flying over suburbia at night.\n\nThat wasn't what gave me the vertigo.\n\n|@ffthewalls>The door opened onto a drop-off. The opposite wall was distant but visible at the edge of our light, so couldn't have been more than a hundred feet away. But the floor and ceiling were gone. Past the doorframe, the wall plunged up and down into limitless blackness. Turning my head carefully to the left and right, I could see the walls also extended into dim infinity in either direction. We were peeking out the side of a canyon that seemed to stretch on forever: up, down, left, and right.\n\nThe walls were pink and pillowy. For a queasy moment they looked like skin, until I realized what they actually were. Fiberglass. The endless walls stretching into the gloom were pink insulation foam, divided by rectangular grids of dusty wood, marked here and there with pencil marks and marred by chipped, discolored edges. We were termites in the walls of a giant's house.\n\nHere and there, other open doorways interrupted the endless pink sea of insulation. Streams of water spilled from some, cascading down into an inky depth that gave back no hint of answering splash. Cascades plunged down from above us, too. The space was filled with a cold and heavy mist.\n]\n\nCurving down from the base of the doorway was [@ffchandelier>a filigreed structure I couldn't at first identify. My impression of ice was wrong: it was laid out more like a spiderweb, a grid of sparkly intersecting lines. As I squinted I realized the sparkles were countless tiny crystals, dangling from some kind of mesh and reflecting back the flashlight in hundreds of shimmering glints. As the web curved down and away it grew denser and denser, strands converging towards a point maybe sixty feet below and another sixty away from the door. The lines of dangling crystal converged there into a dense, scintillating object a couple feet across.|a complex, multi-colored structure I couldn't at first identify. My impression of bricks was wrong, I realized. They were books. A mounded pathway of them: a ribbon of books and long flat pieces of wood, jumbled up like after an earthquake, curving down and away towards a point maybe sixty feet below and another sixty from the door. The chaos converged there into a tall rectangular object, where the sheets of wood became flat and level, interspersed with neat rows of books.]\n\nA {path object}. I blinked. [@ffchandelier>It hung with no obvious point of support above|It sat on] a [@ffset>square platform suspended beneath us in mid-air|long narrow platform covered in junk]. It was as if the {path object} had exploded, but only in one direction, toward us: [@ffchandelier>crystals|books and shelves] multiplying and propagating outward and upward in an ever-widening wave of fractal repetition, connecting the {path object} to our hallway with a web of [@ffchandelier>glass|itselfness].\n[MACRO path object][@ffchandelier>chandelier|bookcase]\n\n“It's a Confusion,” Niko said with a satisfied grin. “Means we're real close now.”\n\n“A what?” I backed away from the horrifying drop-off.\n\n“What I call them.” He shrugged. “Most of Downstairs tends to follow normal architectural rules. Walls, floor, ceiling, measurements more or less what you'd expect. Bedroom objects in bedrooms.” He played his light along the [@ffchandelier>chandelier-net, watching its cut-glass facets sparkle|path of books, embossed titles and snatches of cover art bouncing it back]. “But close to a connection point, things get jumbled up. [@ffthewalls>Perspectives change. Architecture gets stretched to breaking.] Like it's harder to maintain the semblance of order, for some reason.”\n\nI thought of our fridge, in a kitchen with a pool that had a door at the bottom.\n\n“This one,” he added, frowning down, “is pretty fucking weird, though.”\n\nStill struggling with vertigo (tipping forward, arms bound, unable to stop myself as I [@ffchandelier>crashed through the flimsy web|plummeted past that cloud of books] and tumbled [@ffdropoff>into blackness|down that bottomless canyon]) I followed his gaze. The [@ffchandelier>lines of chandelier|stream of book]-stuff converged [@ffchandelier>above|at] what I'd at first seen as [@ffset>a square platform some way below and in front of us. But as I focused on it, I realized it wasn't a platform, but a set. {pp} Only its base was solid, a room-sized square suspended in midair over that awful drop. Thin metal poles sketched out the cube whose floor was defined by the platform, and wires arced up from the cube's top corners and down from its bottom ones into the distance, anchoring it in place. A set, like I said: my first impression was that I was looking down on some ambitious experimental theater production.|a narrow strip of ground some way below and in front of us, itself suspended over that awful drop. But as I focused on the strip of ground, I realized it wasn't a flat surface, but something more complex: a sort of huge tube or pipe, maybe thirty feet thick, stretching away in both directions. {tube description details}]\n\n[MACRO tube description details][@ffdropoff>It made slow, lazy curves as it went, like an immense statue of a snake slithering through grass.

Its endpoints, if any, were lost in darkness.]\n\nAnd it got weirder.\n\nThe [@ffset>floor of the set|tube] appeared to be [@ffset>|made of] the same scuffed, dusty hardwood floor tiles as my bedroom. [@ffset>Tatty throw rugs, dollar-store trash cans, secondhand furniture, and a battered desk filled up the floor space, haphazard: none exactly like the things in my room, but close, as if out of the same catalog, the same tile set.

And a motley collection of bedroom furniture was scattered all around it, also attached in some gravity-defying way to the curved surface. No matter the angle, the furniture rose from the hardwood tube as if down was towards its center. A dresser canted at a forty-five degree angle; the top of a bookshelf poked up around the edge of the curve, like peering over the horizon of a tiny planet.] So yeah, picture looking down at [@ffset>{set overview}|{tube overview}] And all suspended over a [@ffdropoff>miles-high drop down|drop-off] to god knows where, [@ffthewalls>surrounded by endless walls of pink insulation foam, ]connected to us via [@ffchandelier>exploded rays of chandelier|an exploded pathway of library]. \n\n[MACRO tube overview][@ffdropoff>a giant snake that had somehow coated itself in superglue and slithered through {tube overview end}|an immense pipe that had somehow coated itself in superglue and mugged {tube overview end}]\n[MACRO tube overview end][~a secondhand furniture store, encrusting itself with beds, nightstands, dressers, floor lamps (some lit), bookshelves, bureaus, trashcans, and laundry hampers.

Okay then. Who wants to go first?”\n\n{section_break}\n\nIt was me. Surprise. Niko realized he'd have to untie my hands for me to climb down, and if he went first, there'd be nothing to stop me running off back the way we'd come. I'd be running in the wrong direction, away from the supposed portal back to my own side, but I felt like that might be preferable to being the prisoner of a hungry psychopath who looked like a strung-out version of my dead best friend. [Or whatever we were to each other.]\n\n[@ffset>Not that it was apparent the floating platform was anything but a dead end. I protested weakly, but he was firm: {set egress plan} He|Of course, if I went first there'd be nothing to stop me running off along the impossible bedroom-tube, either.

No problemo.”|“The path goes through there. Looks like a dead end from up here but there'll be something when we get down. Some way forward. You'll see.”]\n\n“This probably won't hold your weight,” he added, tugging the rope experimentally. “Not for long anyway. But if I brace myself and take some of the load, it should be enough.”\n\nHe explained the plan while sliding fresh batteries into a headlamp and tightening it onto my head: I would climb down the [@ffchandelier>chandelier net|ribbon of books and shelving] while he and the doorknob stood ready to catch me if I fell. When I got to [@ffset>{set locale desc}|{tube locale desc}]he'd retie the rope to himself, and follow me down while I braced from below. He reminded me that since we'd be tied together, catching him if he fell would be in our mutual interest.\n[MACRO tube locale desc][@ffdropoff>the top of the tube-path---the back of the snake---|the top of the tube-path, ]\n[MACRO set locale desc][~the floating set, ]\n\nHe also mentioned, quite casually, that he had no plans to kill me. Our deal held. Once I got him to the surface, he'd vanish and I'd never see him again. If I messed with him, though---tried to untie my rope while down there and run off, or got funny ideas about yanking it---he would hunt me down. He told me of his expertise at hunting me down---me, personally. He'd done it dozens of times. He'd know which way I'd choose at intersections. Where I'd try to hide. \n\nAnd once he found me, he'd hurt me. He'd spend a long time hurting me.\n\nHe was an expert at that too, he said.\n\nAs if to illustrate this point he pulled out a camping knife with a long, serrated blade and flipped it open: the kind you'd use to saw through small deadwood to make tinder. We'd looked at one just like it at the sporting goods store, my Niko and I, but decided not to get it. After admiring it for a moment, he closed it and attached it to his belt. I wondered if this was less a threat than insurance against being tied together above a gut-clenching drop. Maybe some of each.\n\nHe watched me watching the knife, with cut-glass intensity.\n\n“Time to go,” he said.\n\nI clutched the doorjamb, trying not to stare down at [@ffdropoff>the twinkling lights far below|the bottomless canyon past the edge of the carpet]. Trying to think of some way to get out of this.\n\n“What do you think's down there?” I asked, buying time.\n\nHe didn't look up, focused on a knot. [@ffdropoff>“I think we're above {what we're above}{justification for lights}”|@ffthewalls>“Water,” he said. “Everything ends in water down here. Or maybe we're above {what we're above} Sometimes there's smashed-up stuff down there. Ruined furniture, shattered light bulbs with tangled-up cords.

Twenty feet across. All blinking.]\n\nHe got to his feet, wincing and putting a hand momentarily to his temples. “Okay, quit stalling. Get moving.”\n\n“Hang on.” Fear sweated out of me. “We don't even know if this [@ffchandelier>mesh or net or whatever|book path thing] will hold my weight. Or if this portal you're looking for is even down there.”\n\n“It's down there.” He set his grip on the rope. “I'm sure of that. But as for your first concern...”\n\nHe shrugged, then shoved me, hard.\n\nI flailed, but my body was already past the edge of the door, my hands too slow to grab the frame, world tilting at a sickening angle. My sneaker tried to glue itself to the carpet of the hall but my center of mass was too far out, way too far. My head dropped below my feet and I opened my mouth to scream as I began to fall into nothingness.\n\n{section_break}\n\n[*Ch14Pathway*@ffchandelier>With a tinkling smash, I crashed into the net of chandelier. It was like landing on an uncomfortably studded trampoline, sloped sharply down. For a second everything swayed, nauseating, and I scrambled for a grip, but I was slipping, sliding over the scraping glass baubles, down and sideways towards the edge...\n\nWith a whimper I clutched the mesh beneath me, wrapping my hands around faceted glass and wire and jamming my feet into gaps. One leg was dangling out into the yawning void of empty space, but my other three limbs were all caught.

Moving was awkward: the mesh was a grid of thin metal wire, squares maybe eight or nine inches apart up here, but denser farther down. Little glass baubles dangled from it every few inches, sparkling in the beam of my headlamp. The thing was not comfortable to crawl on, and had enough give that it deformed alarmingly as I shifted my weight. The thin mesh cut into my hands unless I was careful; I'd scraped them both, stopping myself from falling.\n|@ffbookshelves>With a muffled {i/whump}, I crashed into the mountain of books. It would have been like falling onto a lumpy, moss-covered slope, except for the edges of shelves biting into my back. For a second I slowed, a faint cloud of dust and wood pulp rising around me, and then I started to slide.\n\nWith a whimper I grabbed for a handhold and ripped off the cover of a Stephen King paperback. I was picking up speed, scraping and slipping down a slope that was murderously steep, dislodging books that slid away and tumbled down into nothingness. Frantic, I jammed my hands into gaps between them, dug in my left foot. My right was dangling out into the void, but my other three limbs, thank god, were enough to stop me.

I was close enough to get a good look now, and recognized a lot of titles. Sci-fi paperbacks, biology textbooks, graphic novels, biographies of composers. Some of them were books from my own bookshelf, and the rest would have been plausible to find there. Tens of thousands of them. They seemed to be stuck together with something like glue: strong enough for the slope to keep its basic shape, but not strong enough to feel safe trusting your grip to.\n]\n[MACRO somewhere above Niko laughed][~From somewhere above, Niko laughed. “See!” he called down. “Speculate, theorize all you want.

[@ffset>The platform swayed with my momentum: slight, but enough to suggest how thin the wires were that held it suspended, how unknown the strength of their theoretical anchor points, lost in shadow.

He wasn't there. I frowned. The rope tied to my ankle curved up to the lip of the hall, tracing the path of the [@ffchandelier>chandelier-net|books], and vanished inside. I was so far below the hallway now I could only see a few feet of walls and ceiling through its open door. The corridor still seemed lit by the refracted glow of a flashlight, moving around somewhere back there, so I figured he hadn't gone far. Maybe he was untying the rope from the doorknob and tying it to himself, so he could follow me down. But he'd been at it a while.\n\n{i/Shit.} This was an opportunity, and I was squandering it. I glanced down at the rope tied to my ankle, but there were multiple knots, some kind of Navy-ass shit, pulled so tight my foot was losing circulation. Sharp. I needed something sharp. I cast around desperately. A few paces from me was a nightstand with drawers, and I yanked one open, hoping for---I don't know. Something. Anything. But there was only junk inside: a few dusty paperclips, a mechanical pencil with a missing eraser. A single red prize ticket from a skeeball alley.\n\nI stared at it, despair creeping over me.\n\nLight played across my face. I started and looked up, guilty. Niko was back, peering down distractedly from the [@ffdropoff>hanging] doorway, the rope now tied around his waist. [@ffset>The shadows from the wires and cables that held the set suspended played across my face like strands of spiderweb.] He didn't seem to notice what I was doing. He seemed on edge.\n\n“I think there's one of those fucking {double things} up here,” he said. “Way, way back in the hall. At the edge of my light. Doesn't matter. Not going back that way, are we? I'm coming down. Find something to brace yourself on. Brace good and tight,” he added, “because if I fall and you're not secure, you're coming with me, baby.”\n\nMaybe that would be preferable, the best fate for all concerned.\n\nBut maybe he was telling the truth. Maybe he really wasn't planning to kill me. Maybe there was a door up ahead for my key. A way back.\n\n{i/Without Niko?}\n\nMy survival instinct shoved the thought away, like a drowner pushing their rescuer down into the choking depths, desperate to keep their own head above water.\n\n[@ffset>I cast around for something heavy, but the set's furnishings were as accurately cheap as its upstairs inspiration: more particle-board than heavy oak, plastic trash cans but no sturdy hope chests.

I figured he hadn't heard---the [@ffthewalls>forest of insulation|empty space] around us swallowed up sound, creating a surreal distance to everything, like someone had turned down the volume on reality---but when I looked up to shout, Niko was staring back down the hallway behind him again.\n\n“I think it got closer.” He glanced down at me for a moment, face unreadable, then looked back down the hall. “While I wasn't looking. Fucking creepy. In fact…” He trailed off, staring at something I couldn't see. My vantage point only showed a couple feet of ceiling.\n\n“What?” My stomach churned, as if in warning.\n\nHe didn't look away from whatever he was staring at.\n\n“It's got something in its hand,” he said, quite calmly.\n\nNausea swept through me, chemical fear. Hairs prickled all over my body.\n\n“It's coming toward me, Ry.” He was still calm, still staring down the hall. “I'm starting down in twenty seconds. [@fftube>Tie the rope around something.|Figure out a way to brace yourself.] Fast.”\n\nMaybe he was messing with me again. Trying to put the fear of god in me so I'd hurry it up.\n\nOr maybe he wasn't. I knew what his calm tone meant. What he hid behind it. He was fucking terrified.\n\n“I've never seen one move like this,” he said, voice still calm. “It's running down the hall towards me, now. Ryan. Hurry.”\n\nSomething inside me screamed. {i/He's not lying and something is coming and there's nowhere to run and maybe I should let it get him but I'm tied to him I'm fucking tied---}\n\nI ripped my gaze from the [@ffdropoff>floating] hall and cast frantically around the narrow [@ffset>square|path] of safety for [@ffset>something sturdy|something secure, anything heavy].

Footsteps, beating against the carpet. Something running down the hallway, running flat out. A manic run. Fast. As fast as it could.\n\n“Ready,” I shouted up, not sure which side to root for, not sure of anything but the pulse hammering in my ears.\n\nHe nodded once, then pulled his gaze away and swung out over the edge, flipping around to face the [@ffchandelier>net|book-slope], feet feeling for purchase while he clutched the end of the carpet. Focusing on his hands, not glancing down the hall again, he started down. His descent was much quicker than mine, efficient and smooth. But still not fast enough.\n\nIt was coming for him. The footsteps thudded the hall above, creaked loose floorboards. They were close.\n\n“Shit,” he said. “Shit shit shit.” He was still close to the doorway. Too close. \n\n{i/What is it what does it want why is it running what does it have in its...}\n\nWith shocking suddenness a hand wrapped itself around the doorframe. It gripped it tight as a body appeared behind it, skidding on the carpet, coming to a halt on the edge of the drop-off. I shivered as I saw it, every part of me shocked into motion like I'd leapt into an ice-cold stream. I wanted to scream but couldn't. My gaze was fixed on the thing in the doorway.\n\nAnd then I recognized its face.\n\nIt was Niko.

But as he did the gun caught on [@ffchandelier>one of the glass baubles|a dust jacket], and before he could grab it the weapon was sliding and scraping down the [@ffchandelier>net|slope]. Toward the other Niko, who lunged for it, laughing.\n\nIn a clear mental flash I saw what would happen: he'd grab it, he'd shoot young Niko between the eyes; his face would go slack and he'd fall off the [@ffchandelier>net|edge] into the void and vanish, and it wasn't that I loved him or couldn't survive without him but something else, a pure flash of righteous indignant anger rising up in me. After coming back for me, after {i/rescuing} me, when he could and maybe should have left me behind, he didn't deserve to die like this.\n\nElder was stretched out precariously, hand only inches from the gun, and without thinking or planning I grabbed the rope trailing up to him and yanked it, with all the strength I had.\n\nHe let out a {i/whoof} as his torso lurched back, all the air forced out of him, and balanced for a heartbeat at a crazy angle, only one foot touching the [@ffchandelier>jangling net|confusion of books].

I was going to fall beneath him.\n\nDesperate, I reached my hand up, but he was one step ahead of me. He couldn't reach me, but grabbed for the rope trailing behind me, tied to my ankle.

Enough weight for you to climb down his rope.” \n\nI hung indecisive for a long moment. Then, with a sigh like a death rattle, I began to swing. Building up momentum.\n\nReaching for the other rope.\n|I still held the knife against the rope.

Tried to feel the pain in my leg, to let it be an anchor to keep me from floating away.\n\n[@ffset>Eventually I'd swung far enough to grab Niko's rope.

But as it grew taut I realized I had a problem.|I got to the end of my rope and realized I had a problem.] When I'd looped it around the bed I hadn't bothered to even out the two sides. And now, at the end of mine, I was still a few body lengths above Niko. I couldn't reach him. His side had happened to be the longer one, and the only way down to him now would be climbing the last few feet on the other end of the rope. His end.\n\nWhich meant detaching myself from mine.\n\nWith one hand I scrabbled pitifully at the knot, but untying it was hopeless for half-a-dozen reasons, my weight on it not the least. There was only one way to get off my rope onto his.\n\nBelow me, Elder Niko let out a gormless groan, head lolling to one side. But his eyes stayed closed.\n\nA strange clarity had descended on me, the disconnected panic that comes from piling bad decisions on bad decisions, realizing you've gone too far but no longer able to stop. [@ffset>|Shifting my grip to Niko's rope,] I flipped open the knife again, and before indecision could paralyze me, I cut through my own rope, just above the knot at my ankle.\n\nIt was done.

Blood and spittle drooled from the corner of his mouth.\n\nHis fingers twitched in gentle spasms, the last motions of a dying insect.\n\nWe were surrounded by darkness. [@ffdropoff>{maybe light below addendum}]\n[MACRO maybe light below addendum][@TheCity>The faint streetlights miles below, the pools of desk lights and floor lamps above, bookended but did not penetrate the dark we swam together in.]\n\nGripping the rope with one numbing fist, I reached out with my other hand, fingers brushing the edge of his pocket. He groaned again, flopped his head sideways.\n\nI pushed my fingers inside, feeling for the key.\n\nThere.\n\nI pulled it free, carefully, gripping tight as the tines tugged the lining of his pocket, caught on its edge. I focused all my attention on not dropping it, not letting it tumble down into oblivion; on pulling my hand slowly, deliberately, out of his pocket.\n\nWhich is why I didn't notice his eyes had opened. Not until his hand closed around my wrist. \n\n“The fuck,” he muttered, lids heavy, speech slurred, “you doing down there?”\n\nHis grip on me was weak, but I felt the gathering awareness in him, like a coiling viper. His face was smeared with blood, and more had rushed to his head as he dangled, making his face look misshapen, swollen. One of his pupils had dilated all the way open, and a blood vessel in the eye had burst, a spidery red blotch reaching tendrils through the white. He looked monstrous.\n\n[@originalniko>“I let you swim through first,” {elder1}. “Can't remember. Why. Guess I thought I still owed you. A debt.” {elder2}. “Stupid. Wrong. Couldn't find my way.

He scrabbled at my waist with his other hand, pathetic, as if trying to get a grip on my belt to pull himself up. “Sorry for dragging you down here. You deserved... someone better than me to be your friend. And you can hurt me, hunt me, kill me as many times as you want but it'll never change that. Never take it back.” I took a deep breath. “But I can't let you do it any more. You don't deserve to die, but...” My eyes flicked up, then back to his. “Neither does he.”\n\nHe smiled, blood spilling from the corner of his mouth, and as it dribbled away something changed. Like the light had shifted, popped a shadow into a shape. [@gorilla>Like noticing the gorilla in the crowd.|Like pixels in a game turning from smudge to solution.]\n\nThe confusion in his eyes had been a lie. They were perfectly clear. \n\n“Too bad,” he said, “no one gets what they deserve.”\n\nHe had the knife in his hand. My belt. He'd slipped it off my belt while I was babbling.\n\nI swung sideways as he lunged it at my face, and it nicked my ear. There was no grogginess in him, no disorientation. I'd just seen what I'd wanted to see, one last time. I'd never really seen him at all.\n\nMy muscles tensed to fling myself back up the rope, but without the knife I'd never make it. Never be free of him. Certainty flushed through me. This had to end. This had to be the last time.\n\nHe lunged again and I grabbed his wrist, wrenching it backwards, trying to pull the knife free. He snarled and reached for me with his other hand but I twisted away. We swayed and twirled at the end of the rope, the rope I was no longer tied to, clinging instead with one desperate, trembling hand. I felt fibers snapping [@ffset>somewhere above us; this rope wasn't rated to hold two people|as the cut I'd started above us frayed, grew larger]. One way or another this was about to end.\n\nHe stabbed at my face again and I swung to the side, just enough for his hand to brush past me, so I bit down on it as hard as I could. He swore as I ground down harder, feeling flesh give, tasting blood. Sensing his grip loosen, I snatched the knife, his expression of shock burned into my vision even as I turned away, already climbing. Maybe I'd never done that before, in all the times he'd attacked me. Maybe I'd never fought back.\n\nI climbed, the knife clenched between my teeth. For a fleeting moment, and maybe for the first time in my life, I felt like a badass.\n\nBut I'd bought myself only seconds and not enough. I'd pushed well past the limit of my endurance. I barely had the strength to pull myself up. I'd put a few body lengths between us, but he could swallow that lead in seconds. I was a wounded rabbit limping from a wolf.\n\nBelow me something screamed and I realized it was him; a terrible scream, rage and pain and loneliness and betrayal etched onto air.

Bare bulbs hung from the roof every fifty feet or so, leaking dim puddles of yellow-orange glow. Water ran down the center in a foot-deep trench, fast enough to gurgle.]\n\n[MACRO set escape][@ffdropoff>, but Niko had noticed something while scrambling around up top. One of the guy-wires sloping down into darkness had loops of rope tied to it every couple of feet, sized just right to be handholds. You could swing from one to the other, like monkey bars, working your way along and underneath. Unlike the guy-wires themselves which were coated in ages of grime, the loops of rope were clean. They looked like recent additions.\n\nA night's rest had knitted our muscles back together enough to make the traversal merely painful rather than fatal. Grunting and moaning like old men, we swung away from the set into darkness, hand over hand.\n\nBefore long our headlamps picked out a looming shape ahead: a huge concrete tube snaking horizontal through the blackness and cutting across our path on a diagonal. The wire ran just above it, so when we reached it we could simply step down onto its curving top side to shake out our weary arms.\n\nExactly underneath where the cable's path crossed the tube {trapdoor description}\n\nNiko thought we should head upstream, follow the water toward its source. Too worn down to argue, I agreed.|@ffthewalls>, but Elder Niko's plan still seemed sound: get across to a hallway on the other side. On the opposite wall of pink foam from the one we'd entered from, what seemed like ages ago, only one open hall was in reach of our floating set. It took some careful grapple work with our tired muscles, but in the end we managed to traverse over to the hallway, relieved to be standing on solid ground once again.\n\nThis hallway had a floor of concrete, and was wider. A trench of water ran down its center, spilling out into the canyon behind us and cascading down.] We kept to the level ground on either side of the trench, and started trudging.\n\nWe moved slowly. Niko had cleaned up the cut in my lower leg as best he could, [@gayniko>surprisingly tender,] bandaging it with some socks from a dresser drawer and a tight-wrapped bungee cord from his pack. But it hurt, a lot. I hobbled more than walked, had to stop for frequent breaks, or lean on him for support.

[@gayniko>I sometimes saw him looking at me, out of the corner of my eye, but I couldn’t look back.] A small part of me wanted to ask a million questions. Another part didn't want the answers.

After a few more minutes of trudging we reached it.\n\nIt was a [@originalniko>squat and] vaulted brick antechamber, maybe [@originalniko>twelve|thirty] feet across and hexagonal, with tunnels coming in from all six sides. Each seemed identical to the one we'd entered from. Water flooded the sunken floor of the chamber and ran out the trenches in the middle of each tunnel. \n\nIn the center of the room, under the water, was a stubby concrete pillar topped by a metal hatchway with a wheel, like something you'd see on a submarine.\n\nI knew before checking that the hatch would have a keyhole.\n\nOnce we confirmed it did, we became strangely hesitant, our momentum lost. We perched on the lip of a tunnel, dangling our feet in the water, using the excuse that we needed a rest.\n\nThere was so much I should be asking him, so much I should be saying, but I couldn't find a way to start.\n\nWell. I had pretended nothing was wrong for such a long time. Maybe another few minutes wouldn't hurt.\n\n{section_break}\n\nThe rippling sounds of the water were peaceful, and I didn't want to break the silence. But someone had to.\n\n“So.” The sound [@originalniko>bounced|echoed] off vaulted brick[@originalniko>, making the chamber even more claustrophobic]. I coughed. “We've come all this way. We going through, or what?”\n\n[@gayniko>The words seemed to shake him out of a daze, and he perked up, flashing a huge grin. “Hell yeah! Let's do it. Let’s go home.”|He seemed curiously reluctant, but managed a weak smile. “Sure! Yeah. Let's do it.”]\n\nWe waded over to the hatchway. The wheel was inches under the surface of the water. I pulled the key from my pocket and slipped it into the lock, and it went in smoothly. I spun it through a full turn till it made a tiny {i/chunk}, then turned the wheel. After a few revolutions, something gave, and we found we could swing the circular hatch open along one hinged side.\n\nWe held our glowsticks underwater near the opening. The hatch opened into an ordinary-looking but flooded room beneath us with a yellow-tiled floor. Chrome and porcelain rippled up at us. We realized after a moment it was a flooded bathroom.\n\n[“If this portal thing leads through a toilet,” Niko said, “I'm out.”\n\nWe could only assume the way through was somewhere out of sight, around a corner or down an unseen hall. But how far?\n]\n\n“The other guys are probably doing the same thing on their side,” [@originalniko>I|Niko] said hopefully. “Maybe we'll swim through at exactly the same time, go past each other.”\n\n[@originalniko>“Huh.” I looked over; he was staring uneasily into the flooded opening. He caught me looking and forced a smile. “Why not, right? Makes as much sense as anything else.” But his gaze slipped off me and up to the vaulted ceiling, like he was interested in the architecture. He wasn't.\n\nHe was worried about something. \n\nI turned away, ignoring the upwelling of unease, and frowned at the hatch. There was something familiar inside it. |“You really think we're still in sync? After everything that's happened? Our doubles defeated their own evil Niko with exactly the same strategy and ended up here at precisely the same time as us?”\n\nHe shrugged. “Might as well believe that. Because if we don't, and, uh, there's no way back… that would kind of suck.”\n\n“We don't even know if this goes anywhere,” I said. “For all we know, there's a mile of flooded tunnel down there before it mirrors back to our world, if it ever does. You know what would suck more? Drowning.”\n\n“No, look,” he said with a grin, thrusting his light deeper into the circular opening. “There's a guide rope.”\n\n]I squinted, trying to make the wavering underwater shapes resolve. Tied to something just under the hatchway was a climbing rope, the same kind we'd used with our {Grapples}. It stretched down in a taut line out of sight, towards the hidden wall of the room beneath us.\n\n[MACRO wait][I don’t know. Shit.|Wait.]\nNiko[@originalniko>'d seen it too and] reached into the hatch to give it a tug; it seemed taut. [@originalniko>“Thirty-five meter rope,” he said. “Looks like someone marked the way through.”\n\n“Our doubles?”\n\nHe shrugged. “Sure.”\n\n“And this goes through to another hatch like this one, you think? One that opens up onto our original side?”\n\nHe nodded, still not looking at me. “What my evil twin was looking for. The way back through. And if we're lucky, our doubles will be waiting on the other side. Just like this. Getting ready to swap places, swim through. Get everyone back where they belong, all neat and tidy.”\n\n“And, uh. You know this how?” I swallowed. Here was the discussion I'd been too afraid to start, happening anyway.\n\nHe tensed, frowning at his submerged shoes. “I don't {i/know} it. But we might as well believe it, because if they're not there, and there's no more synchronicity between us at all any more? Then who the fuck knows where this rope leads.” He shook his head. “No. They're over there. We have to believe that. They're having this same discussion, right now.”\n\n“{i/They.}”\n\nMy voice broke and he looked up startled, guilty, afraid. Like a texting jaywalker realizing too late he's wandered into traffic.\n\n“Niko,” I said, trembling. “Are you sure you're... I mean, when we got separated...”\n\n{rumblefirst} We both dropped half into a crouch, but the earthquake stopped, the low rumbles far beneath us faded. The water we stood in sloshed drunkenly.\n\n“What the shit was that?” I breathed.\n\n“I don't know.” He nodded, coming to a decision. “But we'd better hurry this up. So. You should go first.”\n\n“Excuse me?” I blinked.\n\n“You're the better swimmer.” He was talking fast, shooting uneasy glances at the walls around us. “If there's anything unexpected or it's too far or whatever, you can come on back. But if you make it through safe, tug the rope a couple times and I'll follow.”\n\n“I thought we'd go together.”|“Thirty-five meter rope,” he said. “And the end's cut off, so it's got to be shorter than that. Looks like someone marked the way through.” He pulled off his shirt and started emptying his pockets.\n\n“What are you doing?” I asked, unsettled.\n\n“No time like the present,” he said. “Might as well get it over with. Come on in, the water's fine.”\n\n] Something was wrong again. The dark circle of the submerged porthole was ominous. Unknown. This was happening way too fast. [@originalniko>“I don't want to go alone.”\n\n“It's the only way.” He gazed at me, fierce. “Orion, just trust me, okay? This will all work out, but you need to trust me right now. Can you do that?”\n\n{trust intro}\n\n“No.” I shook my head, mind racing. {bike bit}|“{wait} What if something happens down there? What if one of us gets stuck, or needs help? We could fucking {i/drown}.” My mind was racing. {bike bit}\n\n“Let's just do it,” Niko said brightly. “I mean, the sooner we go through, the sooner we'll be home.”\n\n“How did you even know this was here?” My throat tightened. His eyes widened.] “No. I can't do this again. Why won't any of you be honest with me? Stop it. I know. {i/I know.}[@originalniko>| You're not... you're not really...]”\n\n[MACRO bike bit][~It felt like riding a bike that kept slipping gears, nothing quite fitting together, accelerating down a hill with less and less control, no way to stop.]\n[@originalniko>{JUMP originalNikoFinale}]\n\n{rumblefirst} [@originalniko>{pp} |And just as this happened Niko reached up, eyes wide, and touched two fingers to my lips. Made a zipping motion across them. I was shocked into silence by it all: the sound, the absurdity of the gesture, his fingers on my lips. The fear on his face.\n\n“Don't,” he said, quiet. “Please.”\n\nWe both took a breath.]\n\n“You have to trust me, Orion. Everything will work out[@gayniko> for us]. Everything. But you have to {i/trust me}, now, here, about this if nothing else.”\n\nThe rumbling receded. The water smoothed out.\n\nHe took another breath[@gayniko>, seemed to notice his fingers were still touching my lips, pulled them back. Stared at them.\n\nAnd as his eyes flicked back to mine I saw something there I’d never seen, no matter how much I’d wanted to. Something hot and desperate, yearning, vulnerable. Something that rippled in the space between us, flickered and grew, a mass, almost a shape.|@firmniko>, dropped his arms to his sides. Fixed me with a look.\n\n“You have to go back,” he said.]\n\nAnd I understood.\n\n{evidence}\n\nHow easily he’d found the [@ffset>right route|trapdoor], led us straight here to the way back through. How sure he was about what I’d find on the other side.\n\n[@gayniko>And the way he’d fought for me. The way he’d been looking at me.]\n\nHe wasn’t my Niko.\n\nThe ground groaned again beneath us, more dangerous this time. A brick fell from somewhere above, made a splash loud enough to make us both flinch. But we didn’t break eye contact.\n\n“Don’t say it,” he breathed.\n\n{synchronicity bit}\n\n[@gayniko>Somehow we were closer than we’d been a moment before. The curves of his jaw, his cheek, were aches inside me, blood-memorized, bone-familiar.]\n\nThe air around us held its breath. Where the water touched my knees, it thrummed.\n\n[MACRO ch16possiblebit][@possibles>The possible|What]\n[@gayniko>His lips were too close to mine. It would be so easy. It would last forever, like dying winter sunlight slanting into a room through melting icicles, lighting it up, setting fire to the neurons that had always struggled to keep truths and fictions apart and burning them away forever, every universe fading away like stage lights until the spotlight of that kiss would be the only thing left. {ch16possiblebit} I’d always wanted made real, at last.\n\n“I want to,” I breathed.\n\n“Then do it.” The need in his eyes was almost too bright to bear.\n\nI shook my head. “Not that. I want to trust you.”\n\nHe blinked. “Then do that.” But I pulled back, biting my lip, and his brow creased with worry. “Can’t you?”\n\n{trust intro} Trust. What a beautiful, fucked-up, irrational concept.\n\nHe kept his gaze locked on mine.\n\n{really see him} {notshadows}\n\n“I’m going through.” I took a deep breath. “But it’s not because I trust you.” He looked alarmed but I raised a hand. “It’s okay. Let me finish. {trustspeech} But Niko, you can’t come with me.” Tears sprung like pinpricks to my eyes, but I blinked them back, fierce. “You {i/can’t come with me}.”\n\n“Bullshit,” he said, stepping forward, even though I could see he knew I was right, see it in how his faced creased with pain. “I belong with you. Your double, on the other side...” An ominous crack sounded from somewhere above us, but he pressed on. “He doesn’t feel the same way about me. I don’t {i/belong} with him.” \n\n{rumble1}\n\n“Niko, stop,” I said, afraid to look away, to even glance at the walls around us, as if they could read the truth in our eyes. “You can’t come through. You know why you can’t.”\n\n|@firmniko>“No,” I said. “I'm not leaving you.”\n\n“You can't stay here,” he said, shaking his head. “You know why you can't.”\n]\n\n“I can live with pain,” [@gayniko>he|I] said, [@gayniko>reaching out for me; but I must have looked shocked, because his expression changed to placating alarm.|stepping toward him; but he recoiled, and I couldn't bear to see him do that, wanted more than anything to make him understand:] “No, it’s okay. [They’re just headaches.] The pain doesn't matter. It’d be worth it. You’re worth it.”\n\n“I’m not.” [@gayniko>I shook my head, angry, never more certain of anything.|He shook his head, folding his arms to stop his hands from shaking.] “You think I could live with myself, putting you through pain like that each day?”\n\n“Everything will be all right,” [@gayniko>he|I] pleaded[@gayniko>, ignoring me]. “It’ll be fine, it’ll all be fine, just let me [@gayniko>come through|stay here with you]. Let me try. {i/Let me try.}”\n\n[@gayniko>And I couldn’t bear to see that need in his face, reflected back at last after all this time, and wondered if he’d seen it too, how sad and jagged and pathetic and painful it was, and how the way I’d hidden it for so long had only made it more of all those things, and I couldn’t stand hurting him anymore, and then the words came that we should have said to each other long before, not that any words could fill the gaps inside us but these were the ones I had and they were better than nothing, so I said them: “I’m not the only one who can love you.”\n\nHe stopped dead, face draining of color. \n\n{rumblepause}\n\nI took a long, ragged breath and realized what I'd said was true. And not just for him.\n\nHe broke our gaze. His eyes fell to the water beneath us like he’d dropped something, watched resigned as it sunk away for good, no longer trying to save it.\n\n“Guess, from your perspective,” he said carefully, “that should have been my line.”\n\n“Yeah, well.” I waved my hand at the architecture around us. “Life’s got a funny way of fucking everything up.”\n\n|@firmniko>\n\nA sharp crack sounded from the wall behind him, but I refused to look away from his eyes, even though all I saw reflected there was my own pain, bitter and jagged. \n\n“And when your double swims through,” he said, lips tight. “The one who belongs on this side. What'll we do with him? Will we kill him, too?”\n\n“Yes,” I said.\n\n{rumble1} I felt a rush of power. I felt filled with potency. Charged. I could bring this whole place down if I wanted. I could change everything.\n\n“Orion,” Niko shouted over the noise, staggering on the unsteady ground. “Stop this. You don't belong here. {i/You have to go back.}”\n\n“There's nothing for me there.” But the momentary flicker of power drained away as I realized I couldn't convince him, could change the architecture as much as I wanted but could never change him, could never accomplish anything from trying but killing us both. I kept my eyes locked on his, refused to blink, {firmnikobit}. “I belong with you,” I cried, “here. I can't go back there. I'd be alone. Don't leave me alone.”\n\nHe froze, face draining of color, and as he did the noise stopped too. The rumbles, the distant groans and tremors, were gone. The quiet thrummed in our ears. I didn't understand.\n\nAnd then I remembered.\n\nSynchronicity.\n\n{i/Don't leave me alone.} It was what he'd said to me, the night of his accident. His mistake. After I'd stopped him from making it. Before the one we made together and had never made right.\n\n{rumblepause}\n\nI took a long, ragged breath. And letting it out I knew the words it should make, the ones we should have said to each other, then and now and so many other times, words that might have brought us closer together instead of the shit we'd sown by leaving them unsaid, by each being too afraid to say them, by denying what had happened and who it had been for and why it had only happened then; and it wasn't that any words could fill the gaps inside us but these were better than nothing, so I said them:\n\n“I love you, Niko.”\n\nIt seemed impossible that I'd never said it before.\n\nHe let out his breath and looked down, unable to meet my eyes. Clenched his fists. “I love you too. But you can't stay here.”\n\n“I know,” I whispered, and closed my eyes.\n\nHe wasn't my Niko, but of course none of them were, had been, could ever be. The Nikos down here, the Nikos in my head; the ones I'd saved, damned, slept with; the ones who needed me, who hated me, who wanted me dead. {notshadows}\n\n“I know,” I said again, “I'll do it. I'll go back. I'll swim through. But not because I trust you.” He looked up, alarmed, but I raised a hand. “{trustspeech}”\n\nI didn't believe it, not really. But saying the words was a good start.\n\n“Sorry I fucked everything up,” I added.\n\n“Yeah, bit late for that.” He waved a hand. “Whatever. Tsunami under the bridge. Apology accepted, I mean.”\n\n]\n\nHe laughed, sudden and loud, and even if things weren’t right, even if the edge between us was jagged and always would be, it was good to hear that laugh again.\n\nWe breathed. It was settled.\n\n“So,” he said. “You’ll swim through. Pass your other.” He swallowed; I nodded. {i/Just my other. Not his.} “And then we’ll each be where we should be.” [@gayniko>His face hardened into a mask as he said this, grim and colorless. Then he looked at me, the corner of his mouth twisting in pain but also a challenge, flinging some of the pain back: “You’ll be fine without me, I guess. Yeah?”\n\nIt did hurt, like he knew it would. Well. At least we were saying truths to each other. Not quite the same as trust, but a good start.|I noticed he didn't say “where we belong” and silently thanked him for that. Belonging was just another kind of longing, I thought, equally stupid to yearn for, to think you could only get from somebody else.]\n\nI stripped down to my jeans, self-conscious, but Niko was spinning a theory about the identical set of clothes I'd find on the other side. If alter-me was swimming through too, he should have had this same thought, and we'd both have dry shirts and shoes waiting, and wasn't that cool?\n\nI wasn't really processing this, still overwhelmed. Trust. Pairs of universes, pulling apart. Drowning, death. Dry clothes seemed like insubstantial details. I tied the glow stick to my belt loop, emptied my pockets of everything non-essential.\n\n“Oh hey,” he said as I did this, affecting it as a casual afterthought, “I want you to take something through for me.” He pulled a plastic bag from his pocket, folded-up pages with something written on them inside. “Hold onto it for a while, okay? Just till you get back through.”\n\n“Sure.” I took the bag. “I suppose I shouldn't read it until---?” A faint judder rippled through the ground; for an instant the water danced in interference patterns.\n\nHe looked pained. “Please, please don't.” Glancing around, he took a deep breath. “Okay. You ready?”\n\nI wasn't, so {final hug}\n\n“Are you going to be okay?” he asked[@gayniko>, without spite this time].\n\nI didn't know how to answer, because despite these tidy revelations, the thought of never seeing him again still stabbed at something deep inside me, and maybe always would; and the idea that anyone in this or any world would ever know me as well as he did seemed impossible. But I nodded. Eventually, maybe, it would be true.\n\n“How about you?” \n\nHe grinned. “I don't plan to spend a couple decades sulking down here like that asshole, if that's what you mean.” He looked up at the arched roof above us, scanning the bricks like there might be constellations in them. “I’ve never known what I wanted, man. Just what everybody else wants me to want. I’m sorry I mixed you up in all that.” He shrugged. “Guess I should figure that out, yeah? Spend some time with myself. Maybe more solo camping, you know? Wandering in the wilderness. Worked for Jesus.”\n\n“Sure,” I said. “You see that wolf again up there, man... you fucking wreck it.”\n\nWe grinned at each other, one last time, or maybe for the first time, depending on how you looked at it: and then {JUMP ch16goodbye}\n\n\n\n\n[LABEL originalNikoFinale]\n\nThe ground trembled again, and Niko took a staggering step toward me, grabbing my arm. “Stop,” he gasped, “Ryan, stop. Don't say it.”\n\n“He showed me a finger,” I whispered.\n\n“Shut up,” he shouted. “Look. Here's what's going to happen. You and your double will swim through together, then me and mine after, and everything will be {i/fine}.”\n\n“But the other Niko,” I gasped, shaking my head, “he's---”\n\n{rumble1} I tripped and plunged into water up to my neck as the earth swayed, groaned like a buried titan coming back to life.\n\nNiko grabbed my arm and pulled me up, put his other on my shoulder, pulled me against him and shouted in my face: “Shut up! Shut up, you fucking idiot, stop talking, stop overthinking everything and just swim through the goddamned tunnel, just swim the fuck through, it's the only way you're going to---” And he cut himself off, biting his lip, his eyes filling up with tears.\n\nAnd then I got it.\n\n{synchronicity bit}\n\nHe knew. He knew there was no other Niko to swim through. Not any more. \n\n{rumblepause}\n\nHe let go of me, took a step back, face reddening. “I just think,” he said quietly, miserable, “that you should go first, okay?”\n\nThe walls around us crunched, coughed, like millions of brick bones having chiropractic work done.\n\nMaybe it was my imagination, but the room seemed smaller.\n\nAnd then something else hit me. Something so hard and huge I forgot how to breathe, and staggered back away from it.\n\n{i/I let you swim through first. Can't remember. Why.}\n\nBricks cracked and popped around us, exploding like popcorn.\n\n{i/Couldn't find my way. Back up.}\n\nHe was reaching for me but I tripped backwards, reflecting his concern with horror. {i/No. No, no, no.} As each brick popped others surged into the gaps they made. The walls were squeezing closer. The room was barely nine feet across, now. Water surged into the runnels leading out, cascading away in all directions like it, too, was terrified.\n\n“It's okay,” Niko was saying, smiling through the tears. But it wasn't. He hadn't been close enough to hear what his elder had been whispering. {i/He didn't know.} “If it doesn't work I'll just stay on this side, retrace our route. No biggie. Get back to the top and so what if there's some headaches[@shadows> and the shadows are weird]. I'll deal.”\n\n“No.” I shook my head. “This can't be what happens, it's not right, it's not fair, it can't end like this...” Something was slipping from my grasp. I tried to hold on to all the stories I'd told myself about Niko, about me; all the endings I'd wanted for us. {notshadows}\n\n“No,” I said again, but stronger this time, stepping forward into the shrinking space, barely the size of a closet now and still getting smaller, “No. This isn't how this ends.”\n\nAnd as the words bounced off the contracting brick that had nearly reached our heads, it held still. The rumbles and groans around us went dead. Everything paused. Everything held its breath.\n\nI looked at him and {really see him}\n\nNone of them were here. The only one here was him.\n\n“You don't owe me anything,” I said, “but I owe you this. At least this.” My voice was hoarse at first but I willed more of my growing conviction into it. “Maybe you're right and going through together, coming face to face with it, would be bad. But maybe not. You think it's coincidence that every cockeyed theory we've had about this place has turned out right? I don't. If it's feeding off us, multiplying us, then we're the prime factor. The base case. You think that if we see the truth, we'll be destroyed. Well, fuck that. I reject it. I reject it with every ounce of my goddamn being.”\n\nI took a deep breath. “Maybe synchronicity matters, maybe it doesn't. I don't really give a shit. What I want is to get us both back home. Look, {trustspeech} And you are fucking coming with me, because I may be the reason you're down here but I swear to god I will also be the reason you get back out.”\n\nThe words lingered in the air. We stayed suspended for a moment, unable to break eye contact, afraid, maybe, to look at anything but each other.\n\nA single brick tumbled from the ceiling and made a tremendous splash. We both started, then laughed, and couldn't stop laughing. We were buried alive and almost certainly going to die but goddamn, we were going to do it together.\n\n“Yeah.” He took a breath, then another. “Yeah, okay. We'll try it your way. You win. This time, dipshit.”\n\nIt was decided. It felt good, and yet painful, too, as some pinprick of knowledge stabbed into me, saying even if we did survive, nothing would ever be the same between us. So without overthinking it {final hug}\n\n[LABEL ch16goodbye] I turned away, toward the submerged portal, the way out, the way home. I stared down at it.\n\nThe thought of swimming into that hole without knowing the way to the other side stabbed a different part of me, the one concerned with oxygen and continued existence. I pushed the fear down but it kept manufacturing images for me: jeans snagging on hidden nails that held me back while I flailed uselessly; huge dead fish swimming the flooded halls with flaking gray skin, bulging eyes growing larger and larger as they closed on me. I imagined drowning. Breathing water instead of air. Spasms of lungs. Knowing you were about to die, only not soon enough. Not nearly soon enough.\n\n[@originalniko>Almost on autopilot I guided Niko through what to expect, through breathing exercises, stroke technique. Calming him down as much as myself. Preparing.\n\nWe started to breathe, deeper and deeper. Priming our lungs with all the air we could.|I took a deep breath, then another. I tried to slow my heartbeat. I didn't look at Niko.\n\nAnother breath. {i/Breathe.} Deeper and deeper.]\n\nI stared at the circular opening, visualized the motions I'd make. I tried to believe I could do this. I tried to push down the sliver of doubt lodged somewhere in my throat.\n\nGripping the sides of the hatch, I paused. I wasn't ready. But if I waited any longer, I'd never be.\n\n[@originalniko>“Last one back to the right dimension buys the drinks,” I said,|“Later, skater,” I said, not looking back,] then took one last huge breath and dove headfirst into the hatch.\n\n\n\n\n[MACRO rumblefirst][~Somewhere far below us, something {i/groaned}, low, immense.

Chromium sink fixtures and a frosted-glass shower threw back {color4adj} light. In contrast to the other flooded chambers there was no mold, no algae, no water damage. It might have been flooded seconds before. \n\nI didn't pause to wonder about this, but kicked off through the open door into a murky hall, following the guide rope which led onwards like Niko had [@originalniko>predicted. He followed behind, pulling himself hand over hand along the rope|said].\n\nI focused on my strokes, old swimming lessons coming back. This was a different sort of lane, of course: the floor brown carpet, plaster-of-paris above instead of a shimmering boundary of air. And the wounded leg slowed me down: it hurt, every time I kicked. But I wasn't worried, not yet. I had good lungs. I could swim for a while.\n\nThe rope turned a corner into a large unfurnished room with a half-dozen washers and dryers piled in a corner. [@originalniko>We|I] swam past them, mechanical, calm, following the rope through an open doorway opposite.\n\nThrough the door was what looked like a small porch or mud room. Boots and shoes tumbled weightless in the water. The rope stopped here, tied to a capped metal pipe. The opposite wall was a sliding glass patio door. \n\nThe airlock.\n\nThrough the glass it was dark. [@originalniko>But faintly, through water rippling as if moving with strange, hot currents, there: another sliding door. Distance was impossible to judge, but it couldn't have been more than twenty-five or thirty feet away, suspended in a dark and empty void.\n\nAnd framed in that window was a figure, silhouetted by the {color4} glowstick he was holding.\n\nAnother me.\n\nIt could have been a mirror, except he was alone.\n\nThe water trembled and around us foundations groaned, but I reached down and grabbed Niko's hand and held it tight against the wriggling water, and he gripped it back. We stared across the gap at my double, defiant. I realized half the sick anxiety I'd been feeling was from my growing proximity to him, subsumed by the general terror of what we were doing. But that wasn't why I gripped Niko's hand so tight.\n\nWe were breaking the rules of this place. Staring asynchrony in the face. And we weren't backing down.\n\nWe were going through anyway.\n\nThe rumbling petered out, died away. Shoes disturbed by the shaking drifted around us, their long laces waving like antennae. \n\nAll this had taken only seconds. I knew every one mattered. Across the gap I saw the other Ryan reach for his sliding glass door, and found myself doing the same, unsure which of us had moved first.\n\nIn lockstep, our doors slid open, and we swam forward into the black water between, me tugging Niko behind. As we reached the portal the floor and ceiling dropped away.|All I could see was my own {color4} reflection holding the glowstick. Seeing myself floating there, a hit of adrenaline coursed through me. How much air was left in my lungs? More than half what I'd started with? Doubt flooded into me. {i/This is crazy. I can't do this.} I forced the thought from my mind, replaced it with: {i/Just hurry. Hurry and get it over with.}\n\nI slid the glass door open and forced myself into the black water beyond. The ground dropped off on the other side, and there was no ceiling, either.] Everything was dark.\n\nAnd as [@originalniko>we|I] swam past the threshold something {i/changed}.\n\n[Everything changed.] The water cooled; the pressure and ambient sound in my ears shifted. [@originalniko>The other sliding door was just ahead of us, but it seemed too as if we|I could see the vague outlines of another sliding door just ahead of me, but it seemed too as if I] floated in a cavernous space, a space beyond measuring, the other door impossibly distant. Disoriented, I turned around to shut the one [@originalniko>we'd|I'd] come through---remembering they couldn't both be open at once---and as I did another shock of {i/change} swept through me, crystallizing into something immense, yawning, terrorful. I remembered the spring Elder Niko had spoken of\n[@vortex>{verse_inline/this stream}|@gardens>{verse_inline_sc/EXPANDING ONCE AGAIN}|@snakeoil>{verse_inline_sc/EXPANDING ONCE AGAIN}|@caves>{verse_inline/pools as clear as air}]\ndeep at the roots of this place: a spring that split and split and split again, endless.

Boundless, multiplied. Multiplicious.\n\nSlowed by dream-syrup, fighting awed stupor from these whispers of immensity, I turned my back on that powerful water at the center, pulled the glass door shut, staring numb as it slid implacable down its track[@originalniko>, while behind me the other Ryan did the same. Our doors clicked shut.\n\nAnd as we turned around to swim across that heady gap, facing each other again, we both raised our glowsticks high. And then we saw them.\n\nDrifting in that immense and empty space, lit a gangrenous {color4} by our chemical lights, there were more of us.\n\nDozens. Floating, unbreathing. Eyes open.\n\nWatching. \n\nI screamed, bubbles of precious oxygen exploding from my mouth, and then they came for us.\n\nI twisted around and|.\n\nIn the last second before the door clicked shut and my glowstick guttered out, I saw something reflected in the glass. There were people floating behind me.\n\nThey drifted in that immense and empty space, lit a gangrenous {color4} by the light of my glowstick. Three of them. All with my body, my clothes. My face. Their wide-open eyes ({i/my} eyes) were fixed on me as they floated gently forward, converging.\n\nTheir grasping hands reached out for me, and then the door clicked shut, and everything went black.\n\nI screamed, bubbles of precious oxygen exploding from my mouth. I] yanked the handle of the door, but it wouldn't budge. I clawed at it, slammed my fist against the glass. [@originalniko>|The darkness was absolute, thickened by the potent water into a solid, crushing thing.] The door wouldn't open and they were right behind [@originalniko>they were coming they were going to get us|me they were coming they were going to get me][@singular02>, a catastrophe of self that nothing human could undo,] and I {i/twisted} wildly, pressed hands to the glass behind me, [@originalniko>but it was hopeless. There were too many of them, drifting forward with hands outstretched, serene expressions on their faces.|trying to guess their position, but it was hopeless. I couldn't see. I'd squandered my air. Hands would close around my neck, my face, and I'd scream again one last time and drown, thrashing in pain and terror and darkness.] [@originalniko>Beside me, Niko was preparing to push off against the glass and make a break for the other side, but faltered as he saw what was happening across from us.\n\nThe other Ryan had failed to open his door, too, but as he'd turned around a coincidence had pried apart our synchronicity even further. There were more of the floating Ryan-things on his side---an accident of distribution maybe---and the few seconds Niko and I had to act had already run out for him. As he bent his legs to push off from the glass door, they reached him.\n\nHe screamed, eyes going wide as their fingers wrapped around his hair, caressed his arms, reached pale white fingers into his mouth. Bubbles of air exploded from it as he twisted frantically, trying to shake them off. Hands closed around his neck, twisted his arms, pulled his head back by his hair to a terrible angle; hands that seemed unsure if they meant to caress or kill. He was panicking, writhing in the water like a trapped eel, dying. \n\nBefore we could move or even start swimming forward to help him, his body spasmed as he breathed in.\n\nHe {i/breathed in}.\n\nIt's a horrible thing to watch yourself drown. My brain disconnected, floated away, observed only in abstractions as the me across the gap spasmed and convulsed, surrounded by things that shared our face, pressing forward, closer, eager, like they wanted to feed off the flicker of his death. The guttering {color4} of his thrashing glowstick was doubled, reflecting mirrored patterns in the glass behind him.\n\nSomething was wrong with that.\n\nMore of the Ryan-things were drifting toward us, Niko was yanking frantic at my arm, but I couldn't move, couldn't react, struggling to grasp that fleeting thought like a half-remembered dream. Neurons tried to spark. The doubled reflection. Something had almost slipped into place. {maybe cdrom bit}\n\nA glowstick and its reflection, now gone horribly still. But the closer one was occluded by the swarming forms, the shadows that swam around it.\n\nThe one in the reflection was clear. In the glass, its light was unobstructed.\n\nIn the glass, there were no swarming figures. They weren't real.\n\n{i/They weren't real.}\n\nThere was no way, no time to explain this to Niko. So I wrapped my arms around him tight, felt for the glass door with my legs, shut my eyes, and pushed off hard towards the swarm of encroaching Orions,|Alone.\n\n{i/No.}\n\nAnger pierced through fear. Maybe I had issues and maybe I'd made mistakes, and maybe I even deserved this, to be strangled by my own soulless doppelgangers in a shitty basement apartment with delusions of grandeur. But I didn't want to die, and being alone had nothing to do with it. I wasn't going to let this happen to me just because {never dad or brad}. None of that mattered. I was still here. I was still alive.\n\nFor now.\n\n{i/Think.}\n\nThey'd been coming from three angles, two above and one below.\n\nIn the middle there'd been a gap.\n\nGripping my panic by the neck before it ran wild, snarling like a cornered animal, I put my feet against the glass door behind me and pushed off hard,] as hard as I could.\n\n[MACRO maybe cdrom bit][@cdrom>Like a puzzle in that damn adventure game, a puzzle you don't even know if there's an answer to until the moment you see it.]\n[MACRO never dad or brad][@dadphone>dad would never be back to tuck me in, just because I'd never hear Niko's laugh again and he wouldn't be there next time to save my ass|@bradphone>my first love had betrayed me and I couldn't forgive him, just because my second was trapped in another universe and I could never, ever see him again]\n\nThe pain in my wounded calf went white-hot but I barely noticed it. I shot straight forward, intent, [@originalniko>right through the mass of things closing in.|threading the gap like a needle, right through the center of the things closing in.\n\nI hoped.]\n\nSomething brushed my leg. I kicked forward[@originalniko> with|, pulled water with cupped hands and] all the strength I had. Two fingertips bounced off my forehead, trailed through my hair, but [@originalniko>we were moving too fast for them, we were through, we were past them|I was moving too fast for them, I was through, I was past them]. I'd [fucking] done it.\n\n[@originalniko>We'd reached the glass door on the other side; below us, the drowned Orion sank into erasing darkness, no longer struggling. I couldn't help him. But Niko was kicking and thrashing in what I'd assumed was terror at the illusory {double things}. To pull the door open I'd have to let him go. But as I did I realized the reason for his panic was far more serious.\n\nHe was out of air.\n\nWhether he'd lost the last of it screaming, whether his smoker's lungs were just inferior to mine: it didn't matter. I could tell at a glance he wouldn't make it to the other side. He wouldn't even make it through the door. His face was filled up with crushing desperation, a look that counted seconds until the overwhelming urge to breathe took hold of him. They were almost gone. His lungs were empty.\n\nSo I pressed my mouth to his and filled them up. I gave him the last of my breath. \n\nHis eyes went wide as he realized what I did, and I could feel him fight to pull back, to stop me. But I held him tight, and anyway I knew he couldn't stop the desperate need of his lungs to expand, to survive, no matter what his forebrain thought it wanted.\n\nIn moments, it was done. I was empty, and he was full. \n\nHe would live. He would be the one who made it.\n\nI pulled back, and as I did the water exploded around us like it had come to life, gone in a snap from still to carbonated. All around us the architecture groaned, flexed, heaved, like it too had come alive.\n\nAcross the gap of thrumming water behind us I saw the glass door we'd come through pull back. Its dimensions and the reflection of my glowstick grew smaller.\n\nThe wall was pulling away.\n\nDesperate, my own need to breathe becoming overwhelming, I faced forward again and tugged the glass door beside us open; but even as I did, Downstairs expanded. {downstairs growing} New glass doors spawned above us, below us, to every side. I ignored it all. I pulled the door open along its rail and grabbed Niko's arm to shove him through.\n\nHe gripped the edge as I did, twisting around to grasp my shoulder. There were no words for the look on his face, or for all the things we'd never said to each other and now never would. There was no time to say them and no air to say them with. I could guess what some of them would have been, maybe, but not others. There was so much of him I'd never really seen, never understood, too caught up in manufacturing other versions of him in my head to know the only one who'd really been there{maybe really there possible bit}. Now I'd never know how much I'd missed. \n\nI pulled back gently from his grasping hand, and smiled, and tried to put everything left I wanted to say into that.\n\nWater frothed around us, twisting, expanding. And then in a flash it began to move. A current tore him from me, limbs flailing, pulling him backward through the mudroom and down the twin of the hall we'd swum through to get here, toward the other hatch. I hoped. Toward the right surface. Even if I'd wanted to follow, I couldn't have: another current of shockingly cold water had wrapped itself around me like a tendril. An angry, biotic undertow pulled me down, straight down, with vicious force. The reflection of my glowstick strobed as the current pulled me past door after door of sliding glass, faster and faster: a flicker, then a dull throb, fading and mingling with the phantom patterns and flashes of color now dancing across my vision as my oxygen-starved brain began to shut down. \n\nIn a moment I'd breathe in, and I wondered what it would be like to inhale those waters of possibility, let that multiplying spring inside me. Let it fill me up. I harbored no illusions, of course: I'd seen it happen to the other Ryan. I'd die. But a beautiful way to go, in the abstract at least. A life spent worrying about possibilities would end by drowning in them. Neat.\n\nThis peaceful thought had so taken me I was caught utterly by surprise when the current shifted and smashed me into a pane of glass with so much force it shattered. Rocketing through a waterlogged hall of turbulent water, surrounded by tumbling fragments of glass, head throbbing and vision expiring, I opened my mouth in shock and, before I could remember I was waiting for a poetic moment to die, breathed in.\n\n|\n\nI surged forward, swimming hard, a savage rictus of victory splitting my face, and then with a crunch and flash of pain I slammed face-first into something hard and smooth. Glass. The door on the opposite side.\n\nSeeing stars, tasting blood, I scrabbled for the handle, but I couldn't find it. My hands slid off smooth glass in every direction. I smeared them across it frantically, up, down, side to side, kicking out with my feet, conscious every second of those things behind me, turning, drifting back towards me, closing in; of the air in my lungs, running low. Running out. \n\nThere: the handle. I pulled it sideways, and as the door slid open in its groove my glowstick came back on, the most glorious shade of {color4} you could possibly imagine.\n\nI kicked forward into the other anteroom and pulled the door shut behind me, not looking back. There was no sign of the things, the {double things}, the echoes, whatever they were. I'd escaped them. My face throbbed with a sharp, spreading pain. But I had a bigger problem. In fact with lightheaded desperation I realized I was in deep, deep shit.\n\nMy air was almost gone. I'd lost some panicking, and my muscles burned through the rest as I shot myself through the airlock. An urge to breathe was taking hold of me, a tingling thrum running through my body as cells clamored for air. My lungs were empty. I couldn't swim again the distance I'd come, either forward or back.\n\nAhead of me, down the mirror-tunnel toward the other hatch and the other junction room, a deep {color4} light burned, brightening. The reflected light from another glowstick.\n\nI watched myself swim into the room, holding it.\n\nAmidst all the panicked horror and desperation, I hadn't noticed the wrongness creep up on me, but now I realized that sick feeling had been there all along, getting stronger, flavoring my more pressing concerns. This wasn't one of the things, I realized. It was me. My double, from the other side.\n\nWe were passing each other, as planned. But the plan had failed.\n\nWe stared at each other and both realized I wasn't going to make it.\n\nBlood diffused from my nose in billowing red clouds; the cut on my leg burned a deep, dangerous ache. My torn fingernails stung where I'd clawed at the door. I was damaged, flawed. The worse-off copy. Looking at him, unharmed, whole, I accepted that I was about to die. It was surprisingly easy. \n\nHe tilted his head, studying me. As if considering something. Or trying to see me, really see me, like I'd tried so many times to see Niko. \n\n{i/Do it}, I thought, {i/I’m too broken to make it. Go back. Or go forward. Just go. Live. Be the one who lives.}\n\nHis expression changed. Just a little.\n\nAnd then he launched himself at me. At once the sense of wrongness spiked, as if approaching some exponential maxima. His face winced at this in exact sympathy with mine, but he didn't pull up, slow down. Instead he crashed right into me, hard. Tumbling, he wrapped his arms around me, held me, did the last thing I'd have ever expected.\n\nHe pushed his mouth to mine, and flooded my lungs with his air.\n\nThe wrongness had reached an unbearable threshold. But as his lips touched mine the sensation exploded outward, like magnets pushed against repelling poles till they slip from your fingers, flip around, snap into place. The water quivered around us; the room groaned, launching wet clouds of mud from splintering lintels, sending subsonic shockwaves shuddering through us. His breath flowed into me. I couldn't think, let alone protest or react. Boots tumbled around us, long laces waving like antennae. I remember that.\n\nAnd then he was empty, and I was full.\n\nHe pulled back, blinked, smiled a smile I knew from the mirror. It meant {i/Oh, well, what you gonna do}.\n\nHe'd picked me.\n\nA huge rumbling crack broke over the growing crescendo of rumbles and groans, and we both looked up. The ceiling had split in a long ugly scar. But the room wasn't collapsing on us. The split filled in almost immediately with new plaster, just as a different split bisected it, which also instantly filled.\n\nThe room was getting bigger.\n\nMy double grabbed my elbow, pushed me toward the hall he'd come in through, the way to the hatch to the other world, my world. And I started to swim. I shouldn't have. I should have thanked him. I should have given back half his air, or dragged him after me, found some way to save him. I should have died. But I didn't. I swam. I swam with everything I had left.\n\nHe'd made a mistake. Bet on the wrong horse. But I wouldn't forget it. I wouldn’t forget him.\n\nAll around me the architecture was groaning, flexing, like something waking up. {downstairs growing} I swam past a crack that didn't fill in but puckered into a new doorway, a flap of wallpaper lengthening and hardening into door. New doorways were spawning all around me; new pits gaped open in the floor. I ignored it all. I swam. I swam for my fucking life.\n\nThe guide rope, taut as a bowstring, snapped, whipping past my face as its two endpoints pulled away from each other. It didn't matter. I knew the way.\n\nI swam into the mirror bathroom, shiny new sinks sprouting on the floor, on the ceiling; the toilet multiplying and splitting in porcelain osmosis, someone's pretentious art project. I swam up to the ceiling---already much higher than a bathroom ceiling should be---put my hands on the wheel of the hatch, and turned.\n\nIt didn't budge. \n\nThe groaning rumbles of hell surrounded me, my body was once again starting to tingle as my second lungful of air reached its end, my face throbbed and my leg was on fire, and the wheel wouldn't turn.\n\nI pounded on the hatch, screaming in fury, the sound utterly lost in the cacophonous eruption of architecture beneath me.\n\nI braced myself, gripped the wheel so hard I thought my knuckles would pop, pulled on it with everything I had.\n\nThen I tried turning it the other direction, and the wheel spun.\n\nI yanked it around, then forced myself up against the hatch, lungs burning, kicking hard, and pushed and swung it up and open, and then I was through, breaking the surface. I breathed, huge and deep. \n\nThen I coughed. Clutching the sides of the hatch, I coughed, blinked, tried to take stock of this new hexagonal room. A huge crack had opened in the floor, and all the water had drained out. The groaning and clanging was sharper up here, out of the water, but mostly coming from beneath.\n\nI pulled myself out of the raised pillar and tumbled to the bucking ground, wiped blood from my face. I was gasping, coughing, bleeding, hurting, panicking, and also, somehow, living. Deservedly or not.\n\nPiled on the lip of one of the tunnels out were a pair of shoes and a dry, folded t-shirt.\n\nAn ear-splitting crack rang off the walls. Bricks fell from the ceiling in a deadly shower, landing a dozen feet away. I grabbed the shirt and pulled it on over my wet torso, slipped the shoes over numb and wrinkled feet. The ground heaved beneath me like the back of a whale taking a colossal breath before diving deep, and as it did it swallowed up the bricks, incorporated them neatly into itself like a child's plastic puzzle pieces falling into matching slots.\n\nThe floor of the bathroom, through the open hatch, was gone. Tile walls descended, vanishing into darkness. They were splitting and rejoining, like some fractal screensaver, an optical illusion in constant motion from the corner of your eye but damnably still if you looked right at it.\n\nSomething was broken. Something had diverged too far. There were too many possibilities and they couldn't all fit. They needed more room.\n\nTime, I decided, to get the hell out.\n\nWith a great belching snap, the floor punctured upwards and a spout of cloudy water billowed up. Another spout exploded from the other side of the room. I picked one of the circular tunnels and started running down it, as fast as I could on my hobbled leg, while behind me the depths of Downstairs sloughed and squirmed into new permutations, unseen. I was too busy living to look back.\n]\n\n[MACRO downstairs growing][~Plaster dust pillowed into the flooded hall in thick weightless clouds as the walls split and reformed, split and reformed, like bones breaking and healing and rebreaking, growing fractionally longer each time.]\n[MACRO maybe really there possible bit][@possibles>, the only one I didn't have to possible]\n\n"

But it gave me an idea.\n\n[@originalniko>|I always wondered what you must have felt, waiting on the other side for your Ryan to come through{maybe imperfect}: waiting while the whole place started to shiver and crumble and expand around you.

That could be me projecting, one last time. But I don't know. It feels right that one of each of us made it out. Balanced.\n\nNot synchronous, but resolved.\n\nI don't have headaches here, which is weird, because it's not the place we started from. Elder Niko said there weren't just two sides, and I thought I got what he meant, but I've stopped trying to pretend we ever understood Downstairs. Anyway, it's different here. Chewing gum isn't a thing, and this asshole named Ted Cruz is president now, which feels like the worst possible timeline, but still. No headaches. This universe is not rejecting me. Maybe I should be insulted, but I suppose I'll have to take what I can get.\n\nYou're not here. I'm pretty sure of that. Hopefully you ended up back where we started. Hopefully that part of the plan worked out.\n\nWe never understood Downstairs, but that hasn't stopped me making up new theories. And I think we were wrong, about a lot of things. \n\nWell. Duh.\n\nBut for example: we always assumed our doubles were on the other side of the fridge from us. But I don't think that's right. I think it was worse than that.\n\n|I'll triple-bag the shit out of this first, though, because, and I hate to say this, the letter you gave me didn't survive my swim through.\n\nThe seal on that baggie must not have been tight. When I finally pulled it out, back on the surface, the letter was soaked through and mostly illegible. Something seemed to have expanded it, too. All that was left was a nightmare of bloated wood pulp and smeared squiggles. Too much of both. But after a lot of tweezer work, I pieced together a little. Not the whole story, but enough to maybe get the gist.\n\nWe were wrong, weren't we? About you guys being trapped on the wrong side, like us.] [@fridgetrapped>We could never figure out why {epYouThey} didn’t use {epYourTheir} keys to come through, since {epYouThey} should have had them both, one bent on the counter and the other stuck in the door. We didn’t think how easy they’d be to miss. How the two of {epYouThem}, coming back to {epYourTheir} own side from an expedition, might have gone straight through without seeing them at all.\n\nHow the four of us all ended up trapped together. Only {epYouThey} had no need for the keys or to get back through, because {epYouThey} were home|Sure, {epYouThey} were trapped just like we were when the fridge connection was broken. But we were wrong when we thought {epYouThey}'d been looking for a way to get back through. Because {epYouThey} were back already,] where {epYouThey} belonged, on {epYourTheir} own side. The problem was that two doppelgangers had followed {epYouThem} through.\n\n[MACRO epYouThey][@originalniko>they|you]\n[MACRO epYouTheyCap][@originalniko>They|You]\n[MACRO epYourTheir][@originalniko>their|your]\n[MACRO epYouThem][@originalniko>them|you]\n\nUs.\n\n{epYouTheyCap} figured it out a lot quicker than we did, I think. How that loss of synchronicity had pulled our twin houses partially apart, like a gardener starting to separate two potted flowers. [@fridgetrapped>Even if we’d had the key, the connection through the fridge was gone. Too shallow, too close to the surface. What would we have found in there, if we’d forced it open? Maybe an endless tunnel of fridge insides: vinyl walls, crisper-drawer floors, stretching to infinity, going nowhere. How’s that for a road to hell?|How the easy way back had been sheared off.]\n\nSo {epYouThey} had to figure out a different way to get rid of us. We were sleeping in {epYourTheir} beds. Eating {epYourTheir} food. Stealing {epYourTheir} lives while {epYouThey} lurked below, afraid to come near us and push things even [further|farther|more] out of sync. Sneaking up to steal food in the middle of the night, thieves in {epYourTheir} own house. And the only way to send us back was to find another connection point, a deeper one, down where roots still twined together. And prod us into finding it, too. {epYouTheyCap} had a lot more time to explore than we did. Downstairs became {epYourTheir} home.\n\n{epYouTheyCap} couldn't explain things to us, not directly. Because if we’d also realized how much things had diverged, it would have tugged our universes even further apart. So {epYouThey} tried to find the subtlest ways to send a message. Saying things without changing hardly anything. Tweaking the note, the video. Pulling us back from the dead-end of the [@empty>crawlways|furniture maze]. Nudging us away from the red herrings closer to the surface, to deeper explorations. Toward the new way through {epYouThey}'d discovered. A flooded tunnel, buried deep. A way to get us back home.\n\nI think about that a lot. We were {epYourTheir} monsters. But {epYouThey} helped us anyway. Maybe {epYouThey} didn't see any other choice, but still. That was pretty great of {epYouThem}.\n\n[@originalniko>|A lot of your note was illegible, and like I said, there seemed to be way too many pages, and a lot of duplicates. But toward the end I could piece together a few phrases, and I think I figured out some of how your story ended.]\n\nOnce {epYouThey}'d found the flooded connection, {epYouThey} could pass through to our home universe, and help clear the way back for us. Leave guide ropes. Make it easy. One of {epYouThem} stayed to keep an eye on us, to make sure we “discovered” the flooded tunnel. Once we did, the plan was probably that {epYouThey}’d swim back through in advance, so that, when the time came, all four of us could pass each other, and the two of us could keep holding onto the thread of belief that synchronicity wasn't broken. At least until we were all in the right place again and what we believed no longer mattered.\n\nBut then that other Niko crept up from the depths of possibility and fucked everything up. {epYouTheyCap} didn't see that coming, I don't think. How could {epYouThey} have?\n\n[Bitterness, multiplied. Multiplicious.]\n\n[@originalniko>Your counterpart, the other Niko from the twin universe---he didn't make it. {i/I always kill the Nikos first}. Well. That's what happened. I saw a finger, and I think, I'm guessing, you found a body. I can't even imagine what that must have been like. But that's why you thought the plan was fucked, that synchronicity was going to collapse the moment we survivors confronted the fact that only one Niko was left. Elder Niko's plan was to take his place, but without him, there was a gap. A flaw in the pairing. And based on everything we knew, you were sure it was a fatal one. It almost was.\n\nWho knows how much of this the other Ryan figured out. I guess all he knew is that his Niko never came back. He must have been scared, confused. Maybe that's why more of the {double things} went for him. Maybe it wasn't coincidence.\n\nSo that's my theory. Probably wrong. I'm sure you have your own. \n\nI guess the details matter less than how we left things.\n\nIt feels like too late and too little to say I'm sorry, but I am. I was lost back then, too afraid to grow up and too wounded to risk being wounded again. But that's not a good enough excuse. I should have been more honest with myself. I should have been more honest with you. I wasn't, and I hurt you, and I can never pay you back for that.\n\n{pizza joke}\n\nThinking back on it all, I do take some comfort that when push came to shove, we choose to save each other rather than turn our backs. Or maybe it wasn't a choice: that wasn't how it felt to me. We just did it. You saved me, on the bedroom {tube or set} above that awful void, and other times besides, when you had every reason to leave me behind. And I gave you the last of my air, not because I didn't want to lose you, but because you were the one who deserved it. That other Niko said it's too bad we don't get what we deserve. But deserving's just another story we tell ourselves, you know? And sometimes, if we try real hard, we can tell it right. \n\n|Did you find your own body, murdered, mutilated, in one of those bland hallways? \n\nI'm so sorry. I can't imagine what that must have been like.\n\nI don’t know quite how to tell you this next part. \n\nYour Ryan never came back because he saved me. He {i/chose} to save me. I don’t know why. I didn’t deserve saving. But he did it anyway.\n\nYou saved me too, of course. On the bedroom {tube or set} above that awful void, and other times besides. And I deserved even less to be saved by you, maybe. Maybe you should have let me die. But you didn't. Neither of you did. And I can never pay you back for that. \n\n{pizza joke}]\n\n[MACRO pizza joke][~I am enclosing ten bucks, though, for the drink you bought me that night at the Russian dance club{mooch bit} I did say I'd get you back, didn't I?]\n[MACRO mooch bit][@originalniko>, lest you think I'm a total mooch.|. I assume your Ryan was as much of a mooch as me.]\n\nI should wrap this up.

If our two universes connect at all any more, it's far down in knotted skeins, hopelessly tangled. I imagine this baggie winding its way through miles of piping, tumbling down moss-covered tunnels, floating through submerged, warped bedrooms. Somehow making its way back up to another surface, another flood. Seems silly. But I see it in my head, vivid. I try to believe [@possibles>it, to possible it|there's a world where it could reach you], even though the odds seem astronomical.  \n\nOn the other hand, with so many possibilities down there, maybe it's inevitable. [Maybe this message will multiply, splitting off into thousands of fractal copies, a million USB keys floating to a million surfaces, ending up in the hands of a lot of confused people but also, too, in yours.\n\n{maybe extra ep coda}|{pp}]Irrational, but true.\n[MACRO maybe extra ep coda][Maybe one of those versions will even seem right to you. ]\n\nI haven’t dreamt about you in years, but I did last night. Not in particulars. Your name [just sort of] floated through me, troubling in some way but not defined. A word repeated until it loses its meaning, becomes obsessed with itself. A reflection's reflection. It’s why I came by the old house, but all that was here was a flooded yard. All it reflected was me.\n\nI never knew what we were to each other back then. Something less than all those things we never were, but more than a friendship. An else-ship, maybe. An other-ship. Traces of mingled shrapnel under shared skin. Broken pieces of each other we tried to make our own.\n\nI guess we’re left with what we had. {i/Have.} Definitely have, yeah? Because we’re gone to each other, but not dead. We survived.\n\nSo hey. I hope you're doing all right [@originalniko>and you found your way back to a world where people say “fourd” like God intended.|in your weird world where people say “fourth” instead of “fourd.”] I hope you found better people to hang out with and a new set of hobbies and someone to appreciate your fashion sense. I hope you realized you were someone worth saving, too.\n\nI miss you sometimes, but that’s okay.\n\nWe made it. And [I think…] I think we’ll be alright. \n\n[Nah. Scratch that.|Or hey. How about this.]\n\nI trust we will.\n\n"
