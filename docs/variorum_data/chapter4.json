It would also sometimes crash when you knocked on a scientist’s door, instead of playing the right video clip—something about a QuickTime corruption error. Worse, it often wasn’t clear whether the puzzles were broken or just mysterious. They consisted of weird alien artifacts that seemed to litter the halls at random: you could always walk right by them, but if you clicked them you’d get a zoomed-in view of their incomprehensible surfaces. Clicking various components or protrusions would produce odd sound effects, morphing animations, or, most of the time, nothing. Sometimes clicking part of a puzzle would take you back to the hall view, as if you’d clicked away. As far as I could tell none of my fiddling had ever done anything. I kept waiting for some clue or Rosetta stone that would help begin to make sense of the alien artifacts. It never came. Either it wasn’t there or I was missing it. Nothing the scientists said in their video clips related to the puzzles, either: they each seemed trapped in their own hallucinatory world of inner demons, and their delusional ramblings didn’t seem connected to each other or the plot, if there even was one. The whole thing was so gloriously baffling that the game became a mild obsession for a while, a surreal distraction to fill the hours I was no longer spending with Niko.",

It would also sometimes crash when you knocked on a scientist’s door, instead of playing the right video clip—something about a QuickTime corruption error. Worse, it often wasn’t clear whether the puzzles were broken or just mysterious. They consisted of weird alien artifacts that seemed to litter the halls at random: you could always walk right by them, but if you clicked them you’d get a zoomed-in view of their incomprehensible surfaces. Clicking various components or protrusions would produce odd sound effects, morphing animations, or, most of the time, nothing. Sometimes clicking part of a puzzle would take you back to the hall view, as if you’d clicked away. As far as I could tell none of my fiddling had ever done anything. I kept waiting for some clue or Rosetta stone that would help begin to make sense of the alien artifacts. It never came. Either it wasn’t there or I was missing it. Nothing the scientists said in their video clips related to the puzzles, either: they each seemed trapped in their own hallucinatory world of inner demons, and their delusional ramblings didn’t seem connected to each other or the plot, if there even was one. The whole thing was so gloriously baffling that the game became a mild obsession for a while, a surreal distraction to fill the hours I was no longer spending with Niko.",
