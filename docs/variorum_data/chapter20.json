How that loss of synchronicity had pulled our twin houses partially apart, like a gardener starting to separate two potted flowers. Even if we’d had the key, the connection through the fridge was gone. Too shallow, too close to the surface. What would we have found in there, if we’d forced it open?

And I gave you the last of my air, not because I didn’t want to lose you, but because you were the one who deserved it. That other Niko said it’s too bad we don’t get what we deserve. But deserving’s just another story we tell ourselves, you know? And sometimes, if we try real hard, we can tell it right.",
