And all I can think of in this moment is Bradley, this cute sweet transfer student who a month before had found out I also liked weird old music, so he corners me after band one day to talk about it. He loves old music, strange music, making weird cross-genre mix tapes, and he plays some for me out of the half-dozen he keeps in his backpack, which is also filled with loose-leaf sheets of staff paper scribbled with notes because oh, he also composes, too, and he’s impossibly cute and I’m so flustered, embarrassed, because as obvious as his interest seems now, back then it’s not even possible for me to consider it. I never once think that he might be like me because I’ve never met anyone like me. We spend hours in the practice room and make plans to hang out again and then the next day in the hall some kid from the varsity team shoves him to the ground, hard, sends his books flying. Calls him a faggot. I’m paralyzed, half a hallway away, frozen while I watch Bradley say something from the ground, a denial, maybe, and the jock is saying something back, evidence, maybe, but I can’t hear because my pulse is pounding in my ears. I’m too afraid or ashamed to go help him, to say anything at all, risk the ugly spotlight of the jock’s face turning on me, too, because he’s clearly making a thing of this, drawing a line. Not in our school. I imagine a chalk outline around Bradley, red graffiti. A queer died here. I can’t move, not even when he finishes collecting his things, gets up, and walks away, taunts at his back, walks down the hall towards me, and now I can move but only to turn away, face flushed and heart galloping, and I can’t look at him and I don’t know if he sees me there as he passes by. But he isn’t at school the next day and the week after I hear he’s transferred somewhere else, and I never see him again. And now in the dark closet as this dumb girl’s lips push against mine all I can think is that it should have been Bradley, my first kiss should have been him, and now I’ve fucked it up, lost it, failed him and myself and even this girl, whose eyes I can’t meet either as I pull away and brush past her out of the closet and past snickering faces to the door outside, changed, maybe, or maybe not. Her hair was in the way, after all, long straight blonde strands of it tasting like strawberry conditioner, so our lips didn’t really even touch, let alone tongues. Was that a kiss? Did it count? Who knows. I don’t feel like it should, and anyway I don’t feel any different except maybe worse, somewhere deep down, even less experienced and less ready and less sure of who I’m supposed to be. I drop out of band not long after that. I’ve always liked listening to music more than playing it, anyway, and I like to listen alone.",

And all I can think of in this moment is Bradley, this cute sweet transfer student who a month before had found out I also liked weird old music, so he corners me after band one day to talk about it. He loves old music, strange music, making weird cross-genre mix tapes, and he plays some for me out of the half-dozen he keeps in his backpack, which is also filled with loose-leaf sheets of staff paper scribbled with notes because oh, he also composes, too, and he’s impossibly cute and I’m so flustered, embarrassed, because as obvious as his interest seems now, back then it’s not even possible for me to consider it. I never once think that he might be like me because I’ve never met anyone like me. We spend hours in the practice room and make plans to hang out again and then the next day in the hall some kid from the varsity team shoves him to the ground, hard, sends his books flying. Calls him a faggot. I’m paralyzed, half a hallway away, frozen while I watch Bradley say something from the ground, a denial, maybe, and the jock is saying something back, evidence, maybe, but I can’t hear because my pulse is pounding in my ears. I’m too afraid or ashamed to go help him, to say anything at all, risk the ugly spotlight of the jock’s face turning on me, too, because he’s clearly making a thing of this, drawing a line. Not in our school. I imagine a chalk outline around Bradley, red graffiti. A queer died here. I can’t move, not even when he finishes collecting his things, gets up, and walks away, taunts at his back, walks down the hall towards me, and now I can move but only to turn away, face flushed and heart galloping, and I can’t look at him and I don’t know if he sees me there as he passes by. But he isn’t at school the next day and the week after I hear he’s transferred somewhere else, and I never see him again. And now in the dark closet as this dumb girl’s lips push against mine all I can think is that it should have been Bradley, my first kiss should have been him, and now I’ve fucked it up, lost it, failed him and myself and even this girl, whose eyes I can’t meet either as I pull away and brush past her out of the closet and past snickering faces to the door outside, changed, maybe, or maybe not. Her hair was in the way, after all, long straight blonde strands of it tasting like strawberry conditioner, so our lips didn’t really even touch, let alone tongues. Was that a kiss? Did it count? Who knows. I don’t feel like it should, and anyway I don’t feel any different except maybe worse, somewhere deep down, even less experienced and less ready and less sure of who I’m supposed to be. I drop out of band not long after that. I’ve always liked listening to music more than playing it, anyway, and I like to listen alone.",

And all I can think of in this moment is Bradley, this cute sweet transfer student who a month before had found out I also liked weird old music, so he corners me after band one day to talk about it. He loves old music, strange music, making weird cross-genre mix tapes, and he plays some for me out of the half-dozen he keeps in his backpack, which is also filled with loose-leaf sheets of staff paper scribbled with notes because oh, he also composes, too, and he’s impossibly cute and I’m so flustered, embarrassed, because as obvious as his interest seems now, back then it’s not even possible for me to consider it. I never once think that he might be like me because I’ve never met anyone like me. We spend hours in the practice room and make plans to hang out again and then the next day in the hall some kid from the varsity team shoves him to the ground, hard, sends his books flying. Calls him a faggot. I’m paralyzed, half a hallway away, frozen while I watch Bradley say something from the ground, a denial, maybe, and the jock is saying something back, evidence, maybe, but I can’t hear because my pulse is pounding in my ears. I’m too afraid or ashamed to go help him, to say anything at all, risk the ugly spotlight of the jock’s face turning on me, too, because he’s clearly making a thing of this, drawing a line. Not in our school. I imagine a chalk outline around Bradley, red graffiti. A queer died here. I can’t move, not even when he finishes collecting his things, gets up, and walks away, taunts at his back, walks down the hall towards me, and now I can move but only to turn away, face flushed and heart galloping, and I can’t look at him and I don’t know if he sees me there as he passes by. But he isn’t at school the next day and the week after I hear he’s transferred somewhere else, and I never see him again. And now in the dark closet as this dumb girl’s lips push against mine all I can think is that it should have been Bradley, my first kiss should have been him, and now I’ve fucked it up, lost it, failed him and myself and even this girl, whose eyes I can’t meet either as I pull away and brush past her out of the closet and past snickering faces to the door outside, changed, maybe, or maybe not. Her hair was in the way, after all, long straight blonde strands of it tasting like strawberry conditioner, so our lips didn’t really even touch, let alone tongues. Was that a kiss? Did it count? Who knows. I don’t feel like it should, and anyway I don’t feel any different except maybe worse, somewhere deep down, even less experienced and less ready and less sure of who I’m supposed to be. I drop out of band not long after that. I’ve always liked listening to music more than playing it, anyway, and I like to listen alone.",

            "text": "I’m in the closet at the back of the band room, sophomore year of high school, and this annoying girl, Missy or Misty or something, has followed me in to grab the music stands, and she’s especially giggly and flighty and nervous for some reason, brushing up against me, and then the lights switch off and she grabs me and I realize it’s a setup, she got someone to stay out there and flip the switch: and in the sudden gloom she grabs me and crushes her lips against mine. And all I can think of in this moment is Bradley, this cute sweet transfer student who a month before had found out I also liked weird old music, so he corners me after band one day to talk about it. He loves old music, strange music, making weird cross-genre mix tapes, and he plays some for me out of the half-dozen he keeps in his backpack, which is also filled with loose-leaf sheets of staff paper scribbled with notes because oh, he also composes, too, and he’s impossibly cute and I’m so flustered, embarrassed, because as obvious as his interest seems now, back then it’s not even possible for me to consider it. I never once think that he might be like me because I’ve never met anyone like me. We spend hours in the practice room and make plans to hang out again and then the next day in the hall some kid from the varsity team shoves him to the ground, hard, sends his books flying. Calls him a faggot. I’m paralyzed, half a hallway away, frozen while I watch Bradley say something from the ground, a denial, maybe, and the jock is saying something back, evidence, maybe, but I can’t hear because my pulse is pounding in my ears. I’m too afraid or ashamed to go help him, to say anything at all, risk the ugly spotlight of the jock’s face turning on me, too, because he’s clearly making a thing of this, drawing a line. Not in our school. I imagine a chalk outline around Bradley, red graffiti. A queer died here.

And all I can think of in this moment is Bradley, this cute sweet transfer student who a month before had found out I also liked weird old music, so he corners me after band one day to talk about it. He loves old music, strange music, making weird cross-genre mix tapes, and he plays some for me out of the half-dozen he keeps in his backpack, which is also filled with loose-leaf sheets of staff paper scribbled with notes because oh, he also composes, too, and he’s impossibly cute and I’m so flustered, embarrassed, because as obvious as his interest seems now, back then it’s not even possible for me to consider it. I never once think that he might be like me because I’ve never met anyone like me. We spend hours in the practice room and make plans to hang out again and then the next day in the hall some kid from the varsity team shoves him to the ground, hard, sends his books flying. Calls him a faggot. I’m paralyzed, half a hallway away, frozen while I watch Bradley say something from the ground, a denial, maybe, and the jock is saying something back, evidence, maybe, but I can’t hear because my pulse is pounding in my ears. I’m too afraid or ashamed to go help him, to say anything at all, risk the ugly spotlight of the jock’s face turning on me, too, because he’s clearly making a thing of this, drawing a line. Not in our school. I imagine a chalk outline around Bradley, red graffiti. A queer died here. I can’t move, not even when he finishes collecting his things, gets up, and walks away, taunts at his back, walks down the hall towards me, and now I can move but only to turn away, face flushed and heart galloping, and I can’t look at him and I don’t know if he sees me there as he passes by. But he isn’t at school the next day and the week after I hear he’s transferred somewhere else, and I never see him again. And now in the dark closet as this dumb girl’s lips push against mine all I can think is that it should have been Bradley, my first kiss should have been him, and now I’ve fucked it up, lost it, failed him and myself and even this girl, whose eyes I can’t meet either as I pull away and brush past her out of the closet and past snickering faces to the door outside, changed, maybe, or maybe not. Her hair was in the way, after all, long straight blonde strands of it tasting like strawberry conditioner, so our lips didn’t really even touch, let alone tongues. Was that a kiss? Did it count? Who knows. I don’t feel like it should, and anyway I don’t feel any different except maybe worse, somewhere deep down, even less experienced and less ready and less sure of who I’m supposed to be. I drop out of band not long after that. I’ve always liked listening to music more than playing it, anyway, and I like to listen alone.",

And all I can think of in this moment is all the guys this could have been, friends I’d been too shy to get close to, guys from the showers or the seat across from me in homeroom, even guys who brushed past me in the hall with a glance and made me crazy for the rest of the day. Three months later I’d meet Bradley and have a real first kiss and all would be forgotten, brushed aside in favor of a thousand better kisses, remembered still despite the awful way they ended. But now in the closet as this dumb girl’s lips push against mine all I can think of is what’s been taken from me, the legend of my first kiss, how I’ve fucked it up, lost it, failed some future boy and myself and even this girl, whose eyes I can’t meet as I pull away and brush past her out of the closet and past snickering faces to the door outside, changed, maybe, or maybe not. Her hair was in the way, after all, long straight blonde strands of it tasting like strawberry conditioner, so our lips didn’t really even touch, let alone tongues. Was that a kiss? Did it count? Who knows. I don’t feel like it should, and anyway I don’t feel any different except maybe worse, somewhere deep down, even less experienced and less ready and less sure of who I’m supposed to be. I drop out of band not long after that. I’ve always liked listening to music more than playing it, anyway, and I like to listen alone.",

I pictured compressed sound waves expanding through miles of hallways, like a dangerous thought lighting up more and more neurons, bouncing off skullbone to keep reflecting, multiplying, feeding on itself. A sound crashing up staircases and down shafts in rippling patterns of interference and reinforcement.

I unclenched my hand and the gun fell into the water, vanishing under the surface without a splash.",
