He insisted the smartest strategy was for us to retrace my steps to the base of the slide and find a way to climb back up. “The closer to the top, the fewer possibilities,” he said, “the fewer choices. And fewer chances of making the wrong one.” When he found out I hadn’t seen my Niko since we got separated in the shaft, he grew even more convinced. “Maybe he’s not down here at all. Maybe he caught himself on the way down, like you said, and he’s up there now waiting for you. Worrying.” He gave up convincing me. “Or if he’s not, he’ll realize heading back is the smart option. I <em>know</em> he would, buddy.” He tapped his head. “Trust me.”",

Sometimes, he said, there were long stretches between lit-up rooms, between scavenged batteries or glowsticks. My skin crawled when I imagined trying to navigate this endless labyrinth by feel, never knowing when you might step into a puddle of water, a bottomless shaft. A body. I thought of him wandering these halls in utter darkness, face placid, eyes unfocused, fingers skimming the paneled wall, the only sound the scuff of sneakers on carpet. Sniffing for rot at hallway junctions. Feeling on hands and knees for corpses and their backpacks of supplies, like a blind crab scavenging for leavings at the bottom of the sea. I thought of getting so used to this that it no longer seemed awful. That it seemed perfectly normal.",

And fewer chances of making the wrong one.” When he found out I hadn’t seen my Niko since we got separated in the shaft, he grew even more convinced. “Maybe he’s not down here at all. Maybe he caught himself on the way down, like you said, and he’s up there now waiting for you. Worrying.” He gave up convincing me. “Or if he’s not, he’ll realize heading back is the smart option. I <em>know</em> he would, buddy.” He tapped his head. “Trust me.”",

He kept asking about the way back up: casually, like making conversation. But he wanted to know what was above the slide, whether we’d come through a fridge or a sliding glass door, whether the junction before the long stairs down had eight doors or six or five, which pit exactly we’d rappelled down, which branch I’d taken off the Big Room to get down here. He was trying to reconstruct the route back out. Maybe this made sense—maybe he was just curious, or hedging his bets in case we got split up, like I had with my Niko—but behind the jokes and easy laughter I sensed calculation. A front.
