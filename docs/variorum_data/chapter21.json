Most would play the same few clips over and over, but some had a surprisingly broad selection.

I might as well have worn a bag over my head, despite Niko’s assurances that The Gays were almost definitely very into Russian techno, he was pretty sure. “Or maybe all those pulsing Slavic rhythms will make some drunk straight guy want to get all experimental and shit,” he said, waggling his eyebrows. “Never know.”",

Brave men had tried swimming through flooded passages, but none had been successful at reaching the boys. Some rescuers had proposed digging a shaft down to them from the surface, but none could agree where to dig: different rescuers had heard the voices coming from very different places, saying very different things.",

It would also sometimes crash when you knocked on a scientist’s door, instead of playing the right video clip—something about a QuickTime corruption error. Worse, it often wasn’t clear whether the puzzles were broken or just mysterious. They consisted of weird alien artifacts that seemed to litter the halls at random: you could always walk right by them, but if you clicked them you’d get a zoomed-in view of their incomprehensible surfaces. Clicking various components or protrusions would produce odd sound effects, morphing animations, or, most of the time, nothing. Sometimes clicking part of a puzzle would take you back to the hall view, as if you’d clicked away. As far as I could tell none of my fiddling had ever done anything. I kept waiting for some clue or Rosetta stone that would help begin to make sense of the alien artifacts. It never came. Either it wasn’t there or I was missing it. Nothing the scientists said in their video clips related to the puzzles, either: they each seemed trapped in their own hallucinatory world of inner demons, and their delusional ramblings didn’t seem connected to each other or the plot, if there even was one. The whole thing was so gloriously baffling that the game became a mild obsession for a while, a surreal distraction to fill the hours I was no longer spending with Niko.",

The cave had been a source of trouble before, it seemed: a forbidden but popular spot for local youths, it had never been mapped but was not believed to be extensive. But it was treacherous in part because of a spring which bubbled up from its depths with unpredictable rhythms, sometimes flooding lower passages or resmoothing upper ones. The spring’s varying flow erased markers and made it hard to tell the twisting tunnels apart, making the cave seem “far larger than its true extent.” It had no official name but the locals had given it various nicknames, among the most popular of which was Looking-Glass Cave, after the clear pool the spring waters sometimes left at its entrance. The article explained that this was a reference to a Robert Louis Stevenson poem taught in local schools which all the kids knew, and which the article reprinted in its entirety. Some of the verses seemed uncomfortably on-the-nose.",

The game’s fans certainly had a type. Curiously, while many of the fan sites promised that full guides or walkthroughs were coming soon, none of them seemed to actually have any, and I started to wonder if it wasn’t just me having trouble with the puzzles. Maybe no one had solved them. Maybe the game was so broken it was impossible to beat.

You did this by wandering the station’s endless metal halls—the transition animations got reused <em>a lot</em>—knocking on the scientists’ doors, and watching tiny video clips of them ranting through narrow metal slots they’d slide open to talk to you. Most would play the same few clips over and over, but some had a surprisingly broad selection.

Brave men had tried swimming through flooded passages, but none had been successful at reaching the boys. Some rescuers had proposed digging a shaft down to them from the surface, but none could agree where to dig: different rescuers had heard the voices coming from very different places, saying very different things.",

It would also sometimes crash when you knocked on a scientist’s door, instead of playing the right video clip—something about a QuickTime corruption error. Worse, it often wasn’t clear whether the puzzles were broken or just mysterious. They consisted of weird alien artifacts that seemed to litter the halls at random: you could always walk right by them, but if you clicked them you’d get a zoomed-in view of their incomprehensible surfaces. Clicking various components or protrusions would produce odd sound effects, morphing animations, or, most of the time, nothing. Sometimes clicking part of a puzzle would take you back to the hall view, as if you’d clicked away. As far as I could tell none of my fiddling had ever done anything. I kept waiting for some clue or Rosetta stone that would help begin to make sense of the alien artifacts. It never came. Either it wasn’t there or I was missing it. Nothing the scientists said in their video clips related to the puzzles, either: they each seemed trapped in their own hallucinatory world of inner demons, and their delusional ramblings didn’t seem connected to each other or the plot, if there even was one. The whole thing was so gloriously baffling that the game became a mild obsession for a while, a surreal distraction to fill the hours I was no longer spending with Niko.",

The cave had been a source of trouble before, it seemed: a forbidden but popular spot for local youths, it had never been mapped but was not believed to be extensive. But it was treacherous in part because of a spring which bubbled up from its depths with unpredictable rhythms, sometimes flooding lower passages or resmoothing upper ones. The spring’s varying flow erased markers and made it hard to tell the twisting tunnels apart, making the cave seem “far larger than its true extent.” It had no official name but the locals had given it various nicknames, among the most popular of which was Looking-Glass Cave, after the clear pool the spring waters sometimes left at its entrance. The article explained that this was a reference to a Robert Louis Stevenson poem taught in local schools which all the kids knew, and which the article reprinted in its entirety. Some of the verses seemed uncomfortably on-the-nose.",

The game’s fans certainly had a type. Curiously, while many of the fan sites promised that full guides or walkthroughs were coming soon, none of them seemed to actually have any, and I started to wonder if it wasn’t just me having trouble with the puzzles. Maybe no one had solved them. Maybe the game was so broken it was impossible to beat.

And then one day at lunch in the cafeteria I was going to break up with him and I think he sensed it coming, wanted to stop it. So he—oh god.” I closed my eyes and, yup, there they were: moisture squeezed out between them. “We weren’t out, you know. In our town. At our school especially. Nobody was. He stands up on the table, little Bradley Thompson, shouts for attention, shouts in a louder voice than I’d ever heard him use that we’re in love, that we didn’t care who knew it, that our love would last forever and nobody in the universe could stop it.”",

You did this by wandering the station’s endless metal halls—the transition animations got reused <em>a lot</em>—knocking on the scientists’ doors, and watching tiny video clips of them ranting through narrow metal slots they’d slide open to talk to you. Most would play the same few clips over and over, but some had a surprisingly broad selection. There were a huge number of doors and scientists, and you had access to all of them right from the start: the game’s puzzles didn’t seem to prevent you from getting to any part of the station.",

Brave men had tried swimming through flooded passages, but none had been successful at reaching the boys. Some rescuers had proposed digging a shaft down to them from the surface, but none could agree where to dig: different rescuers had heard the voices coming from very different places, saying very different things.",

It would also sometimes crash when you knocked on a scientist’s door, instead of playing the right video clip—something about a QuickTime corruption error. Worse, it often wasn’t clear whether the puzzles were broken or just mysterious. They consisted of weird alien artifacts that seemed to litter the halls at random: you could always walk right by them, but if you clicked them you’d get a zoomed-in view of their incomprehensible surfaces. Clicking various components or protrusions would produce odd sound effects, morphing animations, or, most of the time, nothing. Sometimes clicking part of a puzzle would take you back to the hall view, as if you’d clicked away. As far as I could tell none of my fiddling had ever done anything. I kept waiting for some clue or Rosetta stone that would help begin to make sense of the alien artifacts. It never came. Either it wasn’t there or I was missing it. Nothing the scientists said in their video clips related to the puzzles, either: they each seemed trapped in their own hallucinatory world of inner demons, and their delusional ramblings didn’t seem connected to each other or the plot, if there even was one. The whole thing was so gloriously baffling that the game became a mild obsession for a while, a surreal distraction to fill the hours I was no longer spending with Niko.",

The cave had been a source of trouble before, it seemed: a forbidden but popular spot for local youths, it had never been mapped but was not believed to be extensive. But it was treacherous in part because of a spring which bubbled up from its depths with unpredictable rhythms, sometimes flooding lower passages or resmoothing upper ones. The spring’s varying flow erased markers and made it hard to tell the twisting tunnels apart, making the cave seem “far larger than its true extent.” It had no official name but the locals had given it various nicknames, among the most popular of which was Looking-Glass Cave, after the clear pool the spring waters sometimes left at its entrance. The article explained that this was a reference to a Robert Louis Stevenson poem taught in local schools which all the kids knew, and which the article reprinted in its entirety. Some of the verses seemed uncomfortably on-the-nose.",

I found a Yahoo directory page for the game which listed half a dozen fan sites, some of them as obtuse and labyrinthine as the game itself, all riddled with under-construction gifs, hand-drawn maps, questionably relevant web rings, and elaborate self-insert fanfics, or long rants about <em>what it all meant</em> peppered with links to freud.com. The game’s fans certainly had a type. Curiously, while many of the fan sites promised that full guides or walkthroughs were coming soon, none of them seemed to actually have any, and I started to wonder if it wasn’t just me having trouble with the puzzles. Maybe no one had solved them. Maybe the game was so broken it was impossible to beat. I finally uninstalled it and used the hard disk space for <em>Warcraft II</em>, which was less existentially terrifying.",

You did this by wandering the station’s endless metal halls—the transition animations got reused <em>a lot</em>—knocking on the scientists’ doors, and watching tiny video clips of them ranting through narrow metal slots they’d slide open to talk to you. Most would play the same few clips over and over, but some had a surprisingly broad selection.

I’d never really been able to tell. He flirted with everyone, flashed the same manic energy in all directions. I’d worn my rainbow pride bracelet at his insistence, the one I’d bought a few months back and mostly been too chickenshit to wear (it was a college town but a conservative state). I might as well have worn a bag over my head, despite Niko’s assurances that The Gays were almost definitely very into Russian techno, he was pretty sure. “Or maybe all those pulsing Slavic rhythms will make some drunk straight guy want to get all experimental and shit,” he said, waggling his eyebrows. “Never know.”",

Brave men had tried swimming through flooded passages, but none had been successful at reaching the boys. Some rescuers had proposed digging a shaft down to them from the surface, but none could agree where to dig: different rescuers had heard the voices coming from very different places, saying very different things.",

It would also sometimes crash when you knocked on a scientist’s door, instead of playing the right video clip—something about a QuickTime corruption error. Worse, it often wasn’t clear whether the puzzles were broken or just mysterious. They consisted of weird alien artifacts that seemed to litter the halls at random: you could always walk right by them, but if you clicked them you’d get a zoomed-in view of their incomprehensible surfaces. Clicking various components or protrusions would produce odd sound effects, morphing animations, or, most of the time, nothing. Sometimes clicking part of a puzzle would take you back to the hall view, as if you’d clicked away. As far as I could tell none of my fiddling had ever done anything. I kept waiting for some clue or Rosetta stone that would help begin to make sense of the alien artifacts. It never came. Either it wasn’t there or I was missing it. Nothing the scientists said in their video clips related to the puzzles, either: they each seemed trapped in their own hallucinatory world of inner demons, and their delusional ramblings didn’t seem connected to each other or the plot, if there even was one. The whole thing was so gloriously baffling that the game became a mild obsession for a while, a surreal distraction to fill the hours I was no longer spending with Niko.",

The cave had been a source of trouble before, it seemed: a forbidden but popular spot for local youths, it had never been mapped but was not believed to be extensive. But it was treacherous in part because of a spring which bubbled up from its depths with unpredictable rhythms, sometimes flooding lower passages or resmoothing upper ones. The spring’s varying flow erased markers and made it hard to tell the twisting tunnels apart, making the cave seem “far larger than its true extent.” It had no official name but the locals had given it various nicknames, among the most popular of which was Looking-Glass Cave, after the clear pool the spring waters sometimes left at its entrance. The article explained that this was a reference to a Robert Louis Stevenson poem taught in local schools which all the kids knew, and which the article reprinted in its entirety. Some of the verses seemed uncomfortably on-the-nose.",

The game’s fans certainly had a type. Curiously, while many of the fan sites promised that full guides or walkthroughs were coming soon, none of them seemed to actually have any, and I started to wonder if it wasn’t just me having trouble with the puzzles. Maybe no one had solved them. Maybe the game was so broken it was impossible to beat. I finally uninstalled it and used the hard disk space for <em>Warcraft II</em>, which was less existentially terrifying.",

You did this by wandering the station’s endless metal halls—the transition animations got reused <em>a lot</em>—knocking on the scientists’ doors, and watching tiny video clips of them ranting through narrow metal slots they’d slide open to talk to you. Most would play the same few clips over and over, but some had a surprisingly broad selection.

Two neighborhood boys, 15 and 17, had gone exploring in the caves and never come back out. Rescuers sent down had heard faint voices, and it was suspected the pair had been boxed in by rising water. Brave men had tried swimming through flooded passages, but none had been successful at reaching the boys. Some rescuers had proposed digging a shaft down to them from the surface, but none could agree where to dig: different rescuers had heard the voices coming from very different places, saying very different things.",

It would also sometimes crash when you knocked on a scientist’s door, instead of playing the right video clip—something about a QuickTime corruption error. Worse, it often wasn’t clear whether the puzzles were broken or just mysterious. They consisted of weird alien artifacts that seemed to litter the halls at random: you could always walk right by them, but if you clicked them you’d get a zoomed-in view of their incomprehensible surfaces. Clicking various components or protrusions would produce odd sound effects, morphing animations, or, most of the time, nothing. Sometimes clicking part of a puzzle would take you back to the hall view, as if you’d clicked away. As far as I could tell none of my fiddling had ever done anything. I kept waiting for some clue or Rosetta stone that would help begin to make sense of the alien artifacts. It never came. Either it wasn’t there or I was missing it. Nothing the scientists said in their video clips related to the puzzles, either: they each seemed trapped in their own hallucinatory world of inner demons, and their delusional ramblings didn’t seem connected to each other or the plot, if there even was one. The whole thing was so gloriously baffling that the game became a mild obsession for a while, a surreal distraction to fill the hours I was no longer spending with Niko.",

The cave had been a source of trouble before, it seemed: a forbidden but popular spot for local youths, it had never been mapped but was not believed to be extensive. But it was treacherous in part because of a spring which bubbled up from its depths with unpredictable rhythms, sometimes flooding lower passages or resmoothing upper ones. The spring’s varying flow erased markers and made it hard to tell the twisting tunnels apart, making the cave seem “far larger than its true extent.” It had no official name but the locals had given it various nicknames, among the most popular of which was Looking-Glass Cave, after the clear pool the spring waters sometimes left at its entrance. The article explained that this was a reference to a Robert Louis Stevenson poem taught in local schools which all the kids knew, and which the article reprinted in its entirety. Some of the verses seemed uncomfortably on-the-nose.",

The game’s fans certainly had a type. Curiously, while many of the fan sites promised that full guides or walkthroughs were coming soon, none of them seemed to actually have any, and I started to wonder if it wasn’t just me having trouble with the puzzles. Maybe no one had solved them. Maybe the game was so broken it was impossible to beat.
