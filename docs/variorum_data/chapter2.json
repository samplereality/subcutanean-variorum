Niko spent a day in an extraordinary funk of fierce depression followed by an equally intense reversal, like he’d do from time to time, and I took advantage of his high to prod him into going to scope out Downstairs. He took to this plan eagerly, and seemed pleased when I told him I’d been waiting so we could do it together. “Ryan,” he said fondly, “in an emergency, you know, you can do things without me.

Niko spent a day in an extraordinary funk of fierce depression followed by an equally intense reversal, like he’d do from time to time, and I took advantage of his high to prod him into going to explore Downstairs.

Niko spent a day in an extraordinary funk of fierce depression followed by an equally intense reversal, like he’d do from time to time, and I took advantage of his high to prod him into going to scope out Downstairs. He took to this plan eagerly, and seemed pleased when I told him I’d been waiting so we could do it together. “Ryan,” he said fondly, “in an emergency, you know, you can do things without me. I’ll allow it.”",

Niko spent a day in an extraordinary funk of fierce depression followed by an equally intense reversal, like he’d do from time to time, and I took advantage of his high to prod him into going to explore Downstairs. He took to this plan eagerly, and seemed pleased when I told him I’d been waiting so we could do it together. “Ryan,” he said fondly, “in an emergency, you know, you can do things without me. I’ll allow it.”",
