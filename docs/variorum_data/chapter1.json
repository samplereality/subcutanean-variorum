The music was so loud it hurt, almost as much as it hurt to call the shit they were blasting “music.” I’d worn my rainbow pride bracelet, the one I’d bought a few months ago and mostly been too chickenshit to wear (it was a college town but a conservative state). I might as well have worn a bag over my head. Everyone ignored me, including the hypothetical hot guys with loosened inhibitions. I stood against a wall hating myself and hating how I must have looked to everyone, an acne-faced geek in too-small clothes lurking on the outskirts, wishing he was back home listening to Dvořák symphonies. I drank too much, as usual, and as usual it didn’t help. I watched Niko dance his ass off, mostly with girls, and once or twice with guys, whether out of politeness or genuine interest I couldn’t tell. I’d never really been able to tell. He flirted with everyone, flashed the same manic energy in all directions. But he, too, seemed to fail at making any solid human connections, and I was relieved when he cornered me and asked if I wanted to duck out early.",

The night felt endless, anonymous, an escape from daytime problems; the argument that morning already a long-forgotten memory, ancient history. In the fall we’d be starting our fifth year of college, neither of us particularly close to graduating with any particular degree, and for the first time that felt ominous. The future staked out before us our whole lives was running out. A blank canvas ought to have been exciting, but any direction we could imagine to go in seemed blocked off, already closed, inaccessible or unrealistic. Friends were picking already between the remaining well-flagged routes: getting careers, getting married, getting pregnant, getting gone to new cities, new lives, new starts.

(Logically it ought to have been the same size as the house’s footprint, but both the dimensions and orientation were wrong for that.) It had the same beige carpet and brown wall-paneling, tacky faux-bronze wall-sconces, and a plaster ceiling eight feet up. Firewood was stacked up by two fireplaces on opposite walls, in the same style as the non-functional one upstairs hidden by our TV. No windows, not even those awful basement ones that fill up with dead leaves and spider webs. A smattering of old couches and end tables lined the walls, along with the expected bits of floor lint, carpet stains, wall gouges, and other subtle remnants of long occupation. A cool, musty smell suggested said occupation had been a long time ago.",
