That the chandelier-web, part of the Confusion, should follow its own gravitational rules, not the ones that dragged us downwards.

We’d be able to crawl back around to the top, ants between the cloth and the glass.",

The Niko who forgave me. The Niko I’d hurt. The Nikos I’d saved, damned, slept with; the ones who needed me, who hated me, who wanted me dead. The one I’d tried so hard to find, looked everywhere for, down here, up there, inside us both and beyond possibility. Each of them were tales disguised as truths; worlds that I yearned to slip into like tailored gloves, sized just right; stories reassuring me that I finally understood what I deserved, good or bad, where I belonged and who I belonged to, and who belonged to me, where I didn’t have to be alone in a dark bedroom any more with no one who loved me to tuck me in, too afraid to fall asleep.",
