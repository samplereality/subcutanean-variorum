No matter the angle, the furniture rose from the hardwood tube as if down was towards its center. A dresser canted at a forty-five degree angle; the top of a bookshelf poked up around the edge of the curve, like peering over the horizon of a tiny planet. So yeah, picture looking down at an immense pipe that had somehow coated itself in superglue and mugged a secondhand furniture store, encrusting itself with beds, nightstands, dressers, floor lamps (some lit), bookshelves, bureaus, trashcans, and laundry hampers. Escher’s own frat house. And all suspended over a drop-off to god knows where, surrounded by endless walls of pink insulation foam, connected to us via an exploded pathway of library.",

As the web curved down and away it grew denser and denser, strands converging towards a point maybe sixty feet below and another sixty away from the door. The lines of dangling crystal converged there into a dense, scintillating object a couple feet across.",

A profusion of tatty throw rugs clung flat to its surface even on the curving sides, like stickers on a tipped-over water bottle. And a motley collection of bedroom furniture was scattered all around it, also attached in some gravity-defying way to the curved surface. No matter the angle, the furniture rose from the hardwood tube as if down was towards its center. A dresser canted at a forty-five degree angle; the top of a bookshelf poked up around the edge of the curve, like peering over the horizon of a tiny planet. So yeah, picture looking down at a giant snake that had somehow coated itself in superglue and slithered through a secondhand furniture store, encrusting itself with beds, nightstands, dressers, floor lamps (some lit), bookshelves, bureaus, trashcans, and laundry hampers. Escher’s own frat house. And all suspended over a miles-high drop down to god knows where, connected to us via exploded rays of chandelier.",

The lines of chandelier-stuff converged above what I’d at first seen as a narrow strip of ground some way below and in front of us, itself suspended over that awful drop. But as I focused on the strip of ground, I realized it wasn’t a flat surface, but something more complex: a sort of huge tube or pipe, maybe thirty feet thick, stretching away in both directions. It made slow, lazy curves as it went, like an immense statue of a snake slithering through grass. You could walk flat along the top of the snake’s back in either direction, assuming you could get down there in the first place. Its endpoints, if any, were lost in darkness.",
