I don’t recall especially enjoying it: it was just something I did, like a job. Then at school one day someone asked me why I was so into it and I couldn’t tell them. I could hold my breath for forever, which helped, but hardly seemed like a good reason. The truth was I had no idea why I was doing it, and that terrified me. What had made me start? I couldn’t remember.

            "text": "The house in the picture was ours, no question about it: much newer and without the later extensions, but still. The ad was festooned with decorative ribbons with all-caps slogans swirling artfully around the house: RESTORATIVE ELIXIRS and WONDROUS CURE-ALLS and SUCH WONDERS AWAIT YOU. Tiny print along the bottom praised Dr. Henneson’s unmatched skill at distilling his own secret medicinal ingredients from “the cleansing waters of an underground stream of utmost effervescent purity.” The copy got less and less believable as it rambled on: “praised by the crowned heads of Europe” and “a cure to all diseases known by man and science” and “the true American fountain of youth” and so on.",

The visit got off to an ugly start when she asked why I hadn’t brought my colored friend this time. “Actually, he’s Greek,” I said through clenched teeth, and then wished I had the guts to say something else. She served me tea again, weak to the point of tastelessness, and spent so much time making small talk I’d convinced myself she hadn’t found anything and this whole exercise was a waste of time. Worse, she kept glancing at my pride bracelet and pursing her lips, and then pretending not to have done either.

But it was treacherous in part because of a spring which bubbled up from its depths with unpredictable rhythms, sometimes flooding lower passages or resmoothing upper ones. The spring’s varying flow erased markers and made it hard to tell the twisting tunnels apart, making the cave seem “far larger than its true extent.” It had no official name but the locals had given it various nicknames, among the most popular of which was Looking-Glass Cave, after the clear pool the spring waters sometimes left at its entrance.

I don’t recall especially enjoying it: it was just something I did, like a job. Then at school one day someone asked me why I was so into it and I couldn’t tell them. I could hold my breath for forever, which helped, but hardly seemed like a good reason. The truth was I had no idea why I was doing it, and that terrified me. What had made me start? I couldn’t remember. I felt almost violated, possessed, like some outside force had tricked me into driving all my thoughts and energies into moving back and forth through lanes of water, over and over again, for months on end. I stopped not long after, in part because I was hitting puberty and changing clothes in front of other guys was becoming more and more mortifying, but I think really it was because I couldn’t explain that compulsion and it scared me.",
