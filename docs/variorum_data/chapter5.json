We’re obviously in this creepy weird sync with them.” We were in his room with the door shut, and he was pacing the two-and-a-half steps of cleared floor while I lay on his bed, thinking. “Example. Me and the other Niko both went exploring on the same night. The other side, the other house, they were having a party that night too. We both saw that. The decor, uh, such as it was, was the same on both sides, or close enough. He and I were so synced up that we got to the fridge only minutes apart. He beat me, so he came through first, and then we passed in the hall.” He stopped pacing, shuddered, and drummed his fingers on a bulky MIDI keyboard propped up against a wall gathering dust. “Two. A week later, both pairs of us end up getting drunk off vodka on the same night. Oh, there’s these little differences—one side finishes the bottle, the other doesn’t, and this me didn’t get a certain text message that night—but both versions of you decide to go exploring. Again, you get to the pool room only minutes apart. For the most part it’s like we’re staying in a kind of lockstep, despite the superficial differences.”",

We’re obviously in this creepy weird sync with them.” We were in his room with the door shut, and he was pacing the two-and-a-half steps of cleared floor while I lay on his bed, thinking. “Example. Me and the other Niko both went exploring on the same night. The other side, the other house, they were having a party that night too. We both saw that. The decor, uh, such as it was, was the same on both sides, or close enough. He and I were so synced up that we got to the fridge only minutes apart. He beat me, so he came through first, and then we passed in the hall.” He stopped pacing, shuddered, and drummed his fingers on a bulky MIDI keyboard propped up against a wall gathering dust. “Two. A week later, both pairs of us end up getting drunk off vodka on the same night. Oh, there’s these little differences—one side finishes the bottle, the other doesn’t, and this me didn’t get a certain text message that night—but both versions of you decide to go exploring. Again, you get to the pool room only minutes apart. For the most part it’s like we’re staying in a kind of lockstep, despite the superficial differences.”",

I don’t recall especially enjoying it: it was just something I did, like a job. Then at school one day someone asked me why I was so into it and I couldn’t tell them. I could hold my breath for forever, which helped, but hardly seemed like a good reason. The truth was I had no idea why I was doing it, and that terrified me. What had made me start? I couldn’t remember. I felt almost violated, possessed, like some outside force had tricked me into driving all my thoughts and energies into moving back and forth through lanes of water, over and over again, for months on end. I stopped not long after, in part because I was hitting puberty and changing clothes in front of other guys was becoming more and more mortifying, but I think really it was because I couldn’t explain that compulsion and it scared me.",
